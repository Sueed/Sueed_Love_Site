INSERT INTO `sueed_article` VALUES ('1', 'Set in Stone 01', 'What do you do when you write about a certain six thousand year old consultant so much in your letters that it somehow convinces your entire family you\'re not only dating each other, but that you\'re also engaged?\r\n\r\nIn Childe\'s case, the answer is plain and simple: he goes along with it, of course. Absolutely nothing can go wrong if he makes a contract with the God of Contracts, vowing that the two of them will pretend to be lovers for the duration of his family\'s stay in Liyue. Afterwards, they\'ll return as normal and speak no more of this mess. No feelings or complications involved whatsoever.\r\n\r\nContract accepted. A fool-proof plan set in stone. Right?', 'Chapter 1: The Contract\r\n\r\nDearest  Sister,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI hope you’re all doing well back there. As promised, along with this letter, I’ve sent over a crate full of food and new toys for everyone back home. \r\n\r\nI know you liked the porcelain dolls I sent last time, so I’ve had a custom one made especially for you. Zhongli told me that the dress the doll is wearing is called a qipao, and it’s what a lot of the women here wear too. As well as that, I’ve also bought you a hairpin. If you look closely at your doll, you can see that she’s wearing the same one. Once I’m back home, I’ll be sure to do your hair exactly like that and we can use the hairpin then, okay?\r\n\r\nBy the way, be careful with the second crate; it\'s very heavy. It\'s all books that I thought Anthon would enjoy. Zhongli recommended a bunch of titles and I didn’t know which ones to choose, so I got all of them. There’s also a few books about the traditions of Liyue. I started reading them when I first arrived here, but Zhongli provides so much knowledge that being around him feels like having a tour guide with me at all times. I thought Father might be interested in the books instead; you mentioned before that he’s been asking about Liyue?\r\n\r\nMost of the food I’ve sent are snacks. I think you and Teucer will enjoy the milk candies, but make sure to keep them away from Anthon. We don’t want any more, ah, accidents. The frozen buns are called baozi; Zhongli and I ate a lot of them last night for dinner. Just steam them and they should be fine. I recommend the ones with the pork filling!\r\n\r\nThat should be enough to keep you all satisfied for the meantime. If Father’s headaches return, be sure to tell me so I can get him more medicine. \r\n\r\nTake care, my Princess Tonia, and remember to keep your brothers out of trouble for me. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYours faithfully, \r\n\r\nYour loyal knight\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDear Brother, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for the doll and the hairpin! I love them! Mother tried to do my hair like the doll’s but we underestimated how elaborate Liyue hairstyles are, and my hair is far too curly and frizzy for it anyway. If only my hair was neat and pretty too... Still, I will treasure this hairpin forever. I’ve never seen anything so beautiful before!\r\n\r\nOh yes, about the milk candies… Anthon managed to eat a few when we weren’t looking. As expected, he spent that whole evening locking himself up in the bathroom. You can imagine how unpleasant that turned out to be for everyone in the household. Might be best if you don’t send those again in the future… However, Teucer and I did enjoy them a lot. \r\n\r\nFather and Anthon loved the books you sent over. I’ve been reading a few as well, especially the ones about Liyue and its traditions. Everything is so different from Snezhnaya that I find myself constantly at awe with every page I read. Not a day goes by where I don’t regret that I didn’t go with Teucer on his mad adventure there. (Just kidding!)\r\n\r\nBy the way, you seem to be mentioning this Mr. Zhongli a lot in your recent letters… I don’t think Teucer mentioned him at all when he was telling us about his visit there. He’s the consultant at the funeral parlour, is he not? You sound as if you’re fond of him a lot, Brother. \r\n\r\nAs always, I hope you are safe during your travels. Please take care of yourself and know that we are always thinking of you wherever you are in this vast world. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAwaiting for more stories of your adventures, \r\n\r\nYour Princess Tonia\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDear Little Sister,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat are you talking about? Your hair is fine as it is. I will not have you slandering your pretty little self in these letters, or anywhere for that matter. Just wait; when I’m back, I’ll style your hair so good that even your dolls will be envious of you. \r\n\r\nOkay, noted. No more sending dairy products back home unless I want to cause another Anthon Accident. Got it. To compensate, I’ve sent over some red bean buns instead. They’re a bit like the baozi I sent you last time, except these are sweet and filled with red bean paste rather than meat. \r\n\r\nI don’t believe Teucer met Zhongli during his impromptu visit here, but yes, he is the consultant at the funeral parlour. We’ve been spending a lot more time together, considering that he seems to be one of the few people here in Liyue who is not wary of my presence. Before you start fretting, it’s only a bunch of gossip and rumours. I’m fine here, and, besides, Zhongli is plenty of company. \r\n\r\nActually, he’s the one who has been showing me around Liyue. As you can imagine, a Snezhnayan in the middle of Liyue is a rare sight, let alone someone from the Fatui, but Zhongli’s vast array of wisdom has ensured that I do not embarrass myself here. Not too much anyway. Although… Speaking of embarrassing myself, your poor older brother still has not mastered the art of the chopsticks. Who’d have thought two pieces of wood would be so hard to control? Zhongli gifted me with this pair of expensive chopsticks that cost far too much Mora, but I’m afraid they’ll be going to waste at this point. \r\n\r\nEven so, I’ve never seen such fancy chopsticks before. They’re patterned with golden carvings of a dragon and a phoenix. I wish I could show you. \r\n\r\nStay safe, Tonia. Tell Teucer to eat his vegetables, and Anthon to stay away from anything that involves milk. Be sure to send my regards to our parents and elder siblings. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMissing you all, \r\n\r\nYour loyal knight\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDear Brother,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nForgive me for the tone of this letter, but are you and Mr. Zhongli partners????? As in, are you two together? And are you aware of what he meant when he gave you those chopsticks??? \r\n\r\nI’m sorry for how short this letter is, but Mother is currently beside me demanding answers and the thought of waiting for your reply is just too much to bear. \r\n\r\nWe await your next letter with bated breaths. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWishing you (and Mr. Zhongli!) are well,\r\n\r\nYour Princess Tonia\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDearest Tonia,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEh? Of course me and Zhongli are partners. We spend quite a lot of our time together these days too, as I have been dealing with numerous matters here at the Northland Bank. As for the chopsticks, I knew exactly why he decided to give them to me, so there was no way I could refuse them, even if they are unnecessarily expensive. \r\n\r\nI’m confused as to why you and Mother are reacting like this. I thought I mentioned before that Zhongli was my partner?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStay safe and well,\r\n\r\nYour loyal knight\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo my dearest, UNBELIEVABLY SILLY BROTHER OF ALL TIME,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHow could you even ask why we are reacting like this?? OF COURSE we would be shocked at the news that you’re suddenly engaged to Mr. Zhongli! We didn’t even know he was your partner! While the whole household is at a loss for words, I can say for certain that we are OVERJOYED with this news!\r\n\r\nWe’re so happy that you’ve found someone, but we never expected you to arrange your marriage so quickly! Mother has been crying for almost an hour—don’t worry though; they’re tears of joy. And shock—mostly joy, I assure you. \r\n\r\nWe can’t wait to meet Mr. Zhongli! Oh, by the way, have you decided on a date for the wedding yet? And are you having it in Liyue or here in Snezhnaya? Or perhaps both???\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCongratulations and the bestest of best regards to you and Mr. Zhongli,\r\n\r\nYour Princess Tonia\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPaimon\'s laughter is shrill; the perfect volume of ear-piercing torture for Childe to consider using her for target practice. He refrains his murderous intentions and settles for glaring at her as she continues to cackle like she\'s just heard Teyvat\'s funniest fucking joke.\r\n\r\n“Let me get this straight,” Lumine says. Her impassive face is a complete contrast to Paimon literally rolling around in the air still laughing her head off. “You wrote about Zhongli so much in your letters that it’s somehow led your family to believe you’re engaged to him?”\r\n\r\nChilde groans. What a mess. “I didn’t even write about him that much!”\r\n\r\nThere\'s a blur of white as Paimon swoops over the table, waving the letters at his face. “You literally wrote so much that your sister mentions you talk a lot about him here—”\r\n\r\n“Give me that!” Childe snatches the letters from her grasp. Unfortunately, she flies back to Lumine\'s side before he can even entertain the idea of strangling her. “What I don\'t understand is how they ended up thinking I\'m not only dating Zhongli, but I\'m marrying him?”\r\n\r\nPaimon rolls her eyes. “You said you were partners! You confirmed that you were together!”\r\n\r\n“I meant business partners! Business! Partners!”\r\n\r\nAs he\'s busy wondering how the very foundation of his world is ending, Lumine leans over to his side and frowns at the letters.\r\n\r\n“I remember Zhongli telling me something about traditions in Liyue…” she mumbles. “Something about the bride offering chopsticks to the groom as a dowry.”\r\n\r\nChilde blinks. An image of the ridiculously expensive chopsticks that Zhongli gifted him flashes in his mind. They\'re currently back home, still in their box. Last night, Childe tried using them for dinner, but eating noodles with chopsticks when you\'re already half asleep was impossible so he gave up, ignoring the apparition of Zhongli\'s disappointed face his brain conjured up with.\r\n\r\n“Chop… Chopsticks?”\r\n\r\nLumine nods. “Specifically designed with a dragon and a phoenix.”\r\n\r\nOh no, he thinks as realisation hits him like one of Zhongli\'s oversized meteors. Oh fuck.\r\n\r\n“But… B-But that was just a gift! That I had to pay for! He wasn\'t using them as an offering to propose to me!”\r\n\r\nLumine shrugs and Paimon returns to another one of her cackling fits. Around them, everyone in the tea house is sneaking glances, most likely wondering why this suspicious Fatui man is having a mid-life crisis while a half-sized mascot laughs at him for the twentieth time.\r\n\r\nChilde bangs his head on the table in the hopes that it wakes him up from this nightmare. “He gave me those damn chopsticks so I could learn to use them properly!”\r\n\r\nA hand lightly pats his head. “Just send a letter back and explain the truth,” Lumine says, pulling him up.\r\n\r\nAs much as he hates the thought of ruining whatever fantasy his family has already conjured up, Childe nods. It\'s only been over a week since he sent that letter; surely his family must have calmed down by now? They must know that him and marriage are two things that can\'t be in the same sentence, especially when it involves a six thousand year old god.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I\'ll have to,” he sighs. “Before my mother convinces herself I\'ve finally decided to settle down and lead a normal, domestic life.”\r\n\r\nPaimon giggles. “You, normal, and domestic are three things that can never co-exist together.”\r\n\r\nFor once, Childe agrees with her.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe sun has long set by the time Lumine and Paimon leave him to figure out how he\'s going to fix his mess. He barely pays attention to where he\'s going, mumbling an apology every time he bumps into someone in Feiyun Slope. It\'s especially busy at this time with all the merchants packing up their wares and people rushing back home in time for dinner. Childe\'s stomach rumbles, but he ignores it. Instead, he\'s on his seventh mental draft of the letter he wants to send to his sister.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDearest Tonia,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI\'m not getting married, nor am I ever going to get married. Sorry to disappoint you, but—hey, I\'ve bought more kites and dolls for you and the boys. There\'s also a pack of luxury bath soaps for Mother, and more medicine for Father. Now, can we please move on from this?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nYour very stressed but loyal knight\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHm. Maybe he needs to sugarcoat that a bit more.\r\n\r\n“Childe?”\r\n\r\nHe stops in his tracks, looking around him until his eyes meet an amber gaze. Zhongli offers him a gentle smile that sends the mental letter in Childe\'s head disintegrating.\r\n\r\n“Xiansheng,” Childe greets. He nods towards the funeral parlour. “Finished with work already?”\r\n\r\nZhongli walks to his side. “Yes. I was just about to get dinner. Would you care to join me?”\r\n\r\nTranslation: Would you care to join me for dinner that you\'ll end up paying for? Still, Childe nods. He is hungry, and saying no to Zhongli is hopeless.\r\n\r\n“Sure, I could do with some food. Wanmin Restaurant?”\r\n\r\nWanmin Restaurant is as busy as ever when they arrive there. Fortunately, Xiangling is on duty and she manages to clear a table for them. Childe reminds himself to give her a hefty tip after their meal.\r\n\r\nAs usual, Zhongli decides what they\'re getting. Childe prides himself in the fact he\'s had dinner with the consultant so many times that he\'s stopped wincing at all the expensive meals he chooses. Nevertheless, while his face is stoic, he still counts every meal in his head and thinks What the fuck. Golden crab, Qingce stir fry, Jueyun chili chicken, jewellery soup, and jade parcels. Oh, and some fried radish and grilled tiger fish on the side. Tsaritsa, is Zhongli planning to feed all of Liyue?\r\n\r\nHe\'ll never understand how the bank still has any money left with the amount of times he\'s directed their bills towards it.\r\n\r\nBy the time all of the food arrives, there\'s hardly any room for it on their small table. Trusty chopsticks in hand, Childe scans the dishes and wonders what he\'ll eat first.\r\n\r\nHe decides on the jade parcels. Not because they look like they\'ll be the easiest to pick up with chopsticks or anything.\r\n\r\nThe two of them fall into comfortable silence until Zhongli swallows what\'s in his mouth and talks about—anything. Every now and again, he\'ll go off into a tangent about what they\'re eating, explaining to Childe how it\'s cooked and prepared, or the whereabouts of its origins. This happens every time they eat together, to the point where Childe\'s brain is filled with all these recipes he wants to cook for his family one day.\r\n\r\nWhile Zhongli is in the middle of another history lesson, Childe sneaks a glance at him. The glow of the lanterns around them brightens the tips of his hair, almost as if the strands are illuminated during the evening. His amber gaze is tinged with a golden hue so bright that it becomes harder and harder for Childe to tear his eyes away before the consultant notices he\'s quite literally oggling him. He forces his gaze down towards Zhongli\'s hands, focusing instead on the delicate hold he has over his chopsticks, nothing like how Childe is currently holding his like... well, like a knife.\r\n\r\nChilde finds himself frowning. Why did Zhongli give him those expensive chopsticks? Is it true that those are sometimes used as a dowry? Does Zhongli even know that?\r\n\r\nWait, of course he does. Zhongli knows everything and anything when it comes to Liyue. Even so, why would he give them to Childe?\r\n\r\n“Xiansheng, I was wondering…” Childe says. “Those chopsticks you gave me...”\r\n\r\nZhongli\'s head turns to him. The piercing gold of his eyes sends all thoughts inside Childe\'s head scampering off.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nChilde looks away, scrambling for something, anything to say—anything that doesn\'t involve engagements or dowry offerings. “They were a bit expensive, don\'t you think? And I don\'t even know how to use them properly yet.”\r\n\r\nHe hears Zhongli sighing. “I was under the impression that you were trying to improve.”\r\n\r\n“I am! It\'s just...” Childe stabs his chopstick through a jade parcel. “Difficult.”\r\n\r\nHe\'s just about to shove the parcel into his mouth when Zhongli\'s hand envelops his. Childe freezes. He doesn\'t realise he\'s holding his breath until Zhongli pushes the parcel off the chopstick and guides his hand to pick it up properly. Even through their gloves, Childe can feel how warm Zhongli\'s palm is—or maybe that\'s his entire body about to combust.\r\n\r\n“I thought you were someone who liked to master everything he did not excel in.”\r\n\r\nHe makes the mistake of glancing up. Zhongli is leaning over the table, his ponytail swept over his shoulder and his eyes drowned in Cor Lapis. Childe lets out the breath he\'s been holding just as his brain short circuits and comes out with one thought: Why is Zhongli so pretty?\r\n\r\nHe clears his throat and does the only thing he can do to recover: he shoves the entire parcel into his mouth and almost chokes to death.\r\n\r\nZhongli leans back, his lips tugging up into an amused smile. He calls Xiangling to fetch more water for Childe.\r\n\r\n“I am,” Childe says again, when he\'s finished spluttering for air. “Give me more time.”\r\n\r\nZhongli\'s smile drops slightly and he looks down at the chopsticks in Childe\'s hand.\r\n\r\n“I will wait,” he says.\r\n\r\nChilde curls his lip, pushing the food around on his plate. He didn\'t realise Zhongli was that hung up on him being so shit with using chopsticks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen he returns to his chambers, Childe only has enough energy to change into his evening robes before he collapses into bed. In the back of his mind, he recalls that he should be writing a reply to Tonia—but, fuck, he\'ll do that tomorrow morning. The last thing he remembers is a hazy image of Zhongli sitting across from him, his golden-tinted eyes brighter than any lantern that illuminates Liyue\'s vermilion streets.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nScaramouche is doomed and his life is forfeit in Childe\'s hands. As Childe is about to decapitate the evil midget with his own stupidly, large hat, Scaramouche starts screeching and the whole world shakes.\r\n\r\n“Lord Harbinger! Lord Harbinger!”\r\n\r\nChilde jolts awake. It takes him a few seconds to shake himself out of his dream, cursing the fact he couldn\'t at least finish it before he was rudely woken up. Groaning, he rubs his eyes and scans the room, trying to find the source of the voice.\r\n\r\n“Lord Harbinger!”\r\n\r\nThe door. There\'s someone at the door. And by the sounds of it, they\'re either dying or the world is ending.\r\n\r\n“W… What?” Childe clears his throat, wincing at how husky his voice sounds. “What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s your family, sir! One of our men spotted them at the harbour!”\r\n\r\nThat wakes him up. Childe\'s eyes widen and he throws the blankets off him, stumbling for his shoes. “What? Are you serious?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. It seems they have just arrived—”\r\n\r\nChilde is out of the room before the Fatui recruit can take another breath. He trips out of the guest house and ignores the startled shouts from people, probably wondering why in the Abyss he\'s running outside in nothing but his evening robes.\r\n\r\nSeveral thoughts are dashing in his head right now: what the fuck, how the fuck, why the fuck.\r\n\r\nIt\'s got to be a mistake, right? Maybe the Fatui recruit who spotted his family needs glasses and he mistook what he saw. Maybe he was hallucinating. Maybe he was playing around and Childe will have to fight him later for even daring to pull something like this off.\r\n\r\nChilde skids to a stop as soon as he arrives at the harbour, and with that, all of his hopes crumble into ashes. It takes him mere seconds to recognise Tonia\'s curly mane of red hair and the Snezhnayan coats that are far too thick for this kind of weather.\r\n\r\nWHY? he demands to every Archon in existence as his mother turns around, bundled up in several layers of fur, gasping as soon as she sees him. Her pale blonde hair is shorter than he remembers it, yet there\'s no mistaking that it\'s his mother; beautiful and exuberant as always.\r\n\r\nWithin the blink of an eye, Childe is enveloped into a hug that\'s close to breaking his bones and suffocating him in fur. He writhes in her arms, trying to hug his mother back while still demanding WHY to all the existing Archons or godly presence out there.\r\n\r\n“Ajax!” his mother shrieks down his ear. She pulls away and attempts to tidy the mess that\'s his bed hair. After her fourth attempt of trying to flatten a stubborn strand, she gives up and pats his head instead. “Oh my, you’ve gotten so much taller! And so handsome!”\r\n\r\nShe grabs him by the cheeks and turns his face towards his father. Any faster and Childe is certain she would have snapped his neck off.\r\n\r\n“Dear, look at him! Our baby is all grown up!”\r\n\r\nThe \'baby\' in question is now dying from embarrassment. Childe is all too aware of everyone watching them. It doesn\'t help that the harbour is one of the busiest places here in Liyue. From the corner of his eyes, he can see a few Fatui recruits uselessly standing in the distance. They\'re all looking at each other, unsure as to what they can do in a situation like this.\r\n\r\n“Ajax, it\'s good to see you,” his father says. He lays a hand on Childe\'s shoulder and smiles at him. The last time Childe saw his father, his hair was still a full head of red; now, there are also streaks of silver and white. “When Tonia told us you were getting married, your mother didn’t hesitate to find the earliest ship that would take us to Liyue.”\r\n\r\nTonia jumps into his field of vision. Her hair is as wild and untamed as ever, but she\'s no longer the tiny girl with missing front teeth in his memories. When she grins at him, her teeth are straight and dimples press into her freckled cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Brother, I tried to stop them but Mother was so excited!” she says, giggling. “She wouldn’t listen to me!”\r\n\r\nThere\'s a tug at his sleeve and he looks down to find Anthon fixing his wonky glasses.\r\n\r\n“If Teucer can go to Liyue all by himself, then why can’t we?” he says, tugging on Childe\'s sleeve again. “Brother, can you show me to the bookstore? I saved up lots of Mora to buy some—”\r\n\r\nSomeone tugs at his other sleeve. Teucer pops into view, scowling at Anthon.\r\n\r\n“Who wants to go to some boring old bookstore?” He pulls Childe\'s arm, attempting to move him to his side. “Brother, can you show me to the toy factory again? I want to see Mr. Cyclops and all his friends!”\r\n\r\nAnthon huffs, pulling at Childe\'s other arm. Childe can only sigh as his two brothers engage in a tug of war.\r\n\r\n“You already went to the toy factory last time! You don’t need to go there again!”\r\n\r\nTheir mother laughs. She pries her sons\' grip off Childe and gathers them into her arms, ruffling both of their hair until they protest.\r\n\r\n“Now, now, boys. Let’s all calm down and let your poor brother take all of this in. Besides, we can save all the shopping and tourism for another day.” She beams at Childe. “First, we must meet this Mr. Zhongli. Where is he?”\r\n\r\nChilde sincerely hopes he\'s not grimacing. “Ah. Yes. About that—”\r\n\r\n“I’m still in shock that you’ve found someone, let alone decided to get married,” his father says with so much awe in his eyes that you\'d think he\'d just caught Leviathan during their fishing trips. “Our reckless, trouble maker settling down at last…”\r\n\r\n“Wait, that’s actually—”\r\n\r\nHis words are, once again, interrupted as his mother envelops him into another bone-crushing embrace. “Oh, Ajax. You have no idea how delighted we are with this news. As soon as I read your letter, I burst into tears!”\r\n\r\nTonia muffles her laughter with her hand, nodding. “She actually did. She cried for an hour.”\r\n\r\n“And then she cried some more the next morning when she reread your letter,” Teucer adds.\r\n\r\nAt this rate, it sounds like his mother is going to start crying now.\r\n\r\n“It\'s just everything I could ever want for you, Ajax! I was always worried that you were lonely and that you missed home… I\'m just glad you have someone who makes you happy.” His mother sniffs, and Childe prays to the heavens that she won\'t start sobbing in the middle of the harbour. “I think I may start crying again.”\r\n\r\nAnthon rolls his eyes. “Mother, please don\'t. You\'ll set Father off as well.”\r\n\r\nTo Childe\'s horror, their father dabs at the corner of his eyes and starts sniffing.\r\n\r\nChilde sighs. He steps back and takes several deep breaths, then plasters on a smile that could make even the most skilled actors proud of him.\r\n\r\n“Let’s… go back to my place. All of you must be so tired,” he says, still grinning. “I’ll make us some breakfast and… I’ll explain everything.”\r\n\r\nThis is his last hope. If he can get his family to calm down and listen to him for a moment, then he can tell them this is all... one... big... misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“What do you mean you didn’t tell your family the truth in the end?!” Lumine says, and Childe immediately knows it\'s bad when even Lumine is judging him along with Paimon.\r\n\r\nHe lets his head fall into his hands. “I couldn’t do it! I couldn’t look at my mother in the eye and tell her! She was so happy! I can’t ruin that!”\r\n\r\nHe tried. He really did. He went through a dozen speeches in his head while cooking breakfast, but all of it faded away the moment he looked at his mother\'s face. And then all further attempts were thwarted when he looked at the rest of his family and saw they all had similar expressions. Was him getting married that big of a deal?\r\n\r\n“So what? You’re just going to let them believe you and Zhongli are getting married?” Paimon asks. “Paimon thought Teucer believing you were a toy seller was ridiculous, but this is on another level! There’s no way you can pull this off!”\r\n\r\nChilde groans. “I managed to calm them down a bit and tell them the wedding wasn’t for certain yet… Now, they just think Zhongli and I are dating but that we’re considering getting married in the future.”\r\n\r\nLumine\'s eyebrows knit together. She sighs, reaching for her tea. Childe wonders if it\'s too early to start drinking alcohol when noon has barely finished, but damn he needs a drink right now.\r\n\r\n“That’s hardly any better,” Lumine says. “Does Zhongli even know anything about this?”\r\n\r\nChilde\'s silence is enough of an answer.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t told him? You have to tell him!” Paimon demands, swooping dangerously close to his face. “Zhongli is such a blockhead that he’ll probably expose all your lies within seconds if your family ever talk to him!”\r\n\r\nChilde swats her away. “I was getting to that! I’m just… wondering how I can convince him to go along with this.”\r\n\r\nLumine shakes her head. “I can’t believe you’re actually doing this.”\r\n\r\n“What else can I do?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know; maybe tell them the truth? Say it’s all a misunderstanding?” Lumine raises an eyebrow. “Like what most people would do?”\r\n\r\nChilde ignores the sass in her voice. That, coupled with Paimon\'s shrieking is unbearable in the current state of his head right now.\r\n\r\n“No, no, I can’t. My family travelled all the way here just because they were so excited to see me tying the knot. My mother was so happy she started crying! And my father! The only time I ever saw him cry was when we caught a fish that was larger than our house…”\r\n\r\nPaimon jerks back. “First of all, how big are the fish in Snezhnaya…”\r\n\r\nLumine waves her off with a hand. “That\'s not important. How long are your family staying here for anyway?”\r\n\r\nChilde taps on the table, trying to remember. “Two weeks, I think?”\r\n\r\n“So, you’re going to pretend to date Zhongli for two weeks… And then what?” Paimon asks.\r\n\r\n“When they get back to Snezhnaya, I can just say the relationship didn’t work out and that we broke up… Maybe we can even act out an argument before they leave or something. Make it more believable.”\r\n\r\nLumine holds her forehead and mumbles something under her breath. Childe doesn\'t need to hear it to know she\'s currently judging his life choices.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t that upset them anyway?” she slowly says. “Why go through all the trouble of pretending to date Zhongli to not upset them, when you’re only going to do it in the end?”\r\n\r\n“They already believe I’m dating him! I can’t just take it back!”\r\n\r\nPaimon throws her arms in the air. “Because you made them believe it! You’re so stupid!”\r\n\r\n“Shut up! This is the only way forward now!”\r\n\r\nLumine drinks the rest of her tea, the action far too calm for the raging chaos storming through Childe\'s life. “How are you even going to keep your Fatui business away from your family now that they\'re here?”\r\n\r\nHe wishes she didn\'t have to remind him. Thinking about that on top of the Zhongli thing is enough to send him mad. “Everyone apart from Teucer knows I work for the Tsaritsa, so they\'re aware they have to keep it a secret... I\'ll just... have to be extra careful.”\r\n\r\nLumine\'s eyes hold nothing but pity for him. “Of course, there\'s also the matter of whether Zhongli will even agree to this.”\r\n\r\nChilde turns towards the direction of the funeral parlour, easily spotting its balcony from where he\'s sat in the tea house.\r\n\r\n“He will,” he says. “I know he will.”\r\n\r\nIf not... Well, he hopes Wangsheng Funeral Parlour is empty today because he might just resort to begging on his knees.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, the funeral parlour is fairly empty today. Childe follows the scent of incense, so strong he knows it\'ll cling onto him even when he\'s left. He\'s only been to the parlour a few times, and while he\'s not the sort to be easily frightened, he can\'t help but feel there are eyes following him everywhere.\r\n\r\nHe finds Zhongli all alone, huddled over a desk. Childe announces his presence with a light cough, although he\'s sure Zhongli already knew he was there. Don\'t gods have heightened senses or something? Well, in Zhongli\'s case, ex-god.\r\n\r\nZhongli glances up, setting aside his brush. Out of curiosity, Childe looks at what he was writing; the language is foreign and he hasn\'t stayed in Liyue long enough to recognise any of its characters.\r\n\r\n“Childe, this is a surprise,” Zhongli says, motioning towards the seat opposite him. “What brings you here?”\r\n\r\nChilde sits down, mentally flickering through all of the speeches he\'s made this afternoon. As the God of Contracts, Zhongli is used to people asking for help. It\'ll be best if Childe gets down to the point.\r\n\r\n“Xiansheng, sorry to disturb you, but I… I need a favour.”\r\n\r\nZhongli raises an eyebrow, but nevertheless remains silent, waiting for him to elaborate.\r\n\r\nChilde takes a deep breath. “I need you to date me.”\r\n\r\nZhongli blinks.  “Excuse me?”\r\n\r\nShit. “I-I mean—I need you to pretend to date me.” Childe forces out a laugh that sounds more like a cry for help. “Long story short, my family may have misunderstood my letters and they’re now convinced we’re dating. Hilarious, right?”\r\n\r\nHe laughs again, and it\'s the most painful five seconds of his short, pathetic life.\r\n\r\nDoesn\'t help that Zhongli isn\'t laughing. He\'s staring at Childe as if he\'s grown a second head.\r\n\r\nChilde winces. He\'s already started, so he may as well throw away what little is left of his dignity and keep going.\r\n\r\n“They decided to surprise me with a visit out of nowhere. They’re in Liyue for the next two weeks, and I was hoping that you’d… well, I was hoping you’d go along with the act and pretend to date me.”\r\n\r\nZhongli\'s face finally shows a sliver of emotion. He frowns. Childe doesn\'t think that\'s a good reaction.\r\n\r\n“An... act?”\r\n\r\nChilde quickly nods. “Of course, just an act. Once my family leaves, I can tell them we broke up. I know this is so sudden and you’re probably really confused, but I just need you to keep up the lie while they’re here.” He sighs, suddenly remembering one of his mother\'s demands. “They want to meet you as well…”\r\n\r\nFor the longest time, Zhongli is quiet. He turns his head away, staring off into the distance while Childe waits in excruciating silence. Is he angry? Annoyed? Because if so, then what are the chances that he\'s pissed off enough to summon a meteor here and now?\r\n\r\nChilde thinks he\'s losing it. The mental image of Zhongli summoning a meteor right in the middle of Feiyun Slope is both hilarious and concerning.\r\n\r\nThe sound of Zhongli\'s clothes rustling pulls Childe away from his thoughts. When he focuses back on Zhongli, he finds that the ex-Archon is still not staring in his direction. He has his gaze fixed on the table.\r\n\r\n“To summarize, you wish for me to pretend that we are lovers for the duration of your family’s visit. As soon as they leave, the act is no longer needed.”\r\n\r\nIt\'s difficult to determine what Zhongli is thinking right now. His voice is the same as always, soothing and polite, although he\'s talking so slow that Childe worries he\'s greatly offended him.\r\n\r\n“I know this is a lot to ask for, but it’s only for two weeks,” he reassures. “Once that’s over, we can quit the act and that’s it.”\r\n\r\nZhongli slowly nods. He\'s still not looking at Childe and it\'s driving him insane. To make things worse, Zhongli decides now is the best time to pour himself some tea.\r\n\r\nChilde has never been patient, ever, in his life. So, of course, he talks some more in the hopes that it will finally make the older man look at him.\r\n\r\n“Xiansheng, I’m sorry if this makes you uncomfortable, but I promise it’s just for two weeks. I wouldn’t be asking this of you if I wasn’t desperate.” He pauses, suddenly hit with a brilliant idea. “How about this: we can make it into a contract?”\r\n\r\nAs expected, Zhongli finally looks up.\r\n\r\n“A contract?”\r\n\r\nFor a brief second, his eyes are wide and Childe swears the grip he has around his tea cup tightens. As soon as he blinks, it\'s gone and Zhongli\'s face is back to being as cold as stone.\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” Childe nods. “For two weeks, we’ll pretend to be lovers in front of my family, but I promise that as soon as those two weeks are over, the act ends there and we can go back to how things used to be. No feelings or complications. Is that okay? In return, I can buy you anything you—”\r\n\r\nZhongli shakes his head. “I am asking for nothing in return.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure? I know I’m asking a lot from you so—”\r\n\r\n“I am certain.”\r\n\r\nZhongli sits up straighter and stares at Childe directly. The room they\'re in is so dimly lit that the golden flecks in Zhongli\'s eyes are practically incandescent amidst the shadows. In that moment, Childe has the distinct feeling he\'s no longer looking at Zhongli, but the God of Contracts—and here he is, binding himself to one of his contracts.\r\n\r\n“Very well. A maximum period of two weeks to convince your family that we are lovers, and after that, we will resume our relationship prior to this as normal. No feelings or complications will be involved whatsoever. Those are the conditions of this contract?”\r\n\r\nVaguely, Childe recalls that Zhongli does not hesitate to eradicate those who break his contracts. One part of his brain, albeit a very small one, tells him he should probably be careful with this.\r\n\r\nOf course, he ignores that voice in his head. Besides, what can go wrong? The conditions are that they\'ll only be pretending for two weeks, and after that, everything will return back to normal. That\'s what Childe wants, and he knows the same must go for Zhongli.\r\n\r\n“Right,” he agrees. “Those are the conditions of this contract.”\r\n\r\nZhongli inhales a deep breath, setting his tea cup down. “Then it is agreed upon. I will place my trust on you and this contract between us.” Golden eyes narrow at him. “Betray it, and you taint my blood.”\r\n\r\nChilde laughs. He leans forward to shake the ex-Archon\'s hand.\r\n\r\n“Contract accepted,” Childe says, and just like that, everything is set in stone.', 'set_in_stone.jpg', '2021-04-10 07:12:50.285735', '2021-04-26 10:15:17.611594', '0', '1', 'set_in_stone_01', '1', '2', 'Set in Stone');
INSERT INTO `sueed_article` VALUES ('2', 'Set in Stone 02', 'the same with 01', 'Chapter 2: Just Practice\r\n\r\nThe weight of accepting Zhongli’s contract is instantaneous. Childe looks down at their hands, still locked in a handshake that he’s slowly realising has lasted far too long, and thinks ‘Now what?’\r\n\r\nFor starters, it would be a good idea to let go of Zhongli. Now. \r\n\r\nChilde pulls away, watching as Zhongli relaxes back into his chair as if he hasn’t just agreed to what may be one of Childe’s dumbest plans in his life so far. Now that Zhongli has agreed to it, Childe is at a loss as to what happens next. He didn’t actually think it would be that easy to get the Archon to say yes. Part of him expected (and hoped) to fight Zhongli, maybe beat him into submission until he had no choice but to accept Childe’s crazy plan. \r\n\r\nOf course, Childe is aware Zhongli wouldn’t have gone down without a fight… That’s what makes it sound more alluring… Damn, he really should have challenged him to a duel first instead of proposing a contract. \r\n\r\n“You mentioned your family wishes to meet me?”\r\n\r\nChilde snaps away from his thoughts. He mentally grimaces at the memory of his mother pretty much demanding to meet Zhongli as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n“Yeah. Are you okay spending dinner with us at my place tomorrow?”\r\n\r\nZhongli nods. “I can do that.”\r\n\r\nGreat. Approximately twenty-four hours until he meets his doom. \r\n\r\n“We must ensure that we act like lovers in front of them,” Zhongli tells him. \r\n\r\n“Right,” Childe agrees. \r\n\r\nLovers. What a strange concept. He’s never bothered with a serious relationship before; being one of the Tsaritsa’s Harbingers doesn’t exactly give one much time to pursue anything outside of the occasional alcohol-induced one night stand. Even then, sex and romance are two completely different things. He’s always regarded sex as another form of battle; depending on who you’re with, it can be exhilarating, it can be boring.\r\n\r\nAs for romance, he’s completely stumped with that one. \r\n\r\n“So, holding hands and pretending to be madly in love and all that,” Childe suggests like the expert he clearly is. \r\n\r\nZhongli frowns. “Lovers do more than just hold hands.”\r\n\r\nChilde’s eyes flicker to Zhongli’s lips before he realises what he’s doing. He quickly looks away, but the damage is done. Now his brain is populated with images of kissing the ex-Archon; an image he\'d never thought of before, although… Well, he’s not against it. They’ll have to do it at some point if they want to make this believable, won’t they?\r\n\r\n“I know that,” he mumbles. “My family’s already on board with the idea that we’re considering engagement at this point, so I don’t think they need much convincing.”\r\n\r\nHe says it to reassure both Zhongli and his sanity, but it only makes the ex-Archon’s frown deepen. \r\n\r\n“If that’s the case, then would they not be suspicious if our actions do not match that?” Zhongli asks. \r\n\r\nChilde shrugs. “I suppose you’re right… Are you okay with, uh, kissing and stuff?” \r\n\r\nEloquently put, Childe, the asshole part of his brain tells him. Kissing and stuff. He’s pretty sure they won’t need to do anything beyond kissing, unless this contract is really set out on making him lose what little sanity he has left. \r\n\r\nZhongli doesn’t even look fazed at all. “I have accepted a contract with you,” he says, calm as ever. “I will do anything that’s required of me.”\r\n\r\nNot really the best thing to be saying when Childe’s brain is still ambushing him with images that are gradually becoming more and more inappropriate. \r\n\r\n“Okay. That’s… That’s cool.”\r\n\r\nTo distract himself from his increasingly unholy thoughts, he stands up and pretends to be interested in one of the scrolls hanging on the wall. He can’t understand a single character that’s written on it and it doesn’t help he can feel Zhongli’s eyes piercing straight through his back. \r\n\r\n“We’ll need to decide on our history.”\r\n\r\n“History?” Childe looks over his shoulder. Zhongli has returned to filling in the paperwork he’d been doing before he arrived here. He’d almost forgotten he barged in here while Zhongli was working. Deciding it’d be best to wait, Childe folds his arms and leans on the table behind him—\r\n\r\nIt wobbles. He regains his balance as quickly as he can and throws his hands out to steady the table. When he turns around, he sees that it’s more of a counter with a white sheet draped above, hiding whatever is below it. He hears Zhongli let out an unimpressed sigh just as something slides out from under, landing by Childe’s feet.\r\n\r\nAn arm. It’s an arm cleanly sliced from someone’s torso. \r\n\r\nChilde whistles, unable to help himself. He bends down to pick it up, intending to shove it back under the covers until his curiosity gets the better of him. Lifting the corners of the sheet, he inspects the body underneath and raises his eyebrows at the neat precision of the wound. He’s never seen such a clean cut before.\r\n\r\n“Damn,” he says, impressed. “Whoever killed them must have had an amazing blade. A cut this neat would have felt like slicing into butter.”\r\n\r\nZhongli coughs. “Childe. Please leave the corpse alone.”\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” Childe says, much like a kid reprimanded by their parents. He attempts to move the arm back to where it was, but it tumbles down on the floor with a loud thud. “Drat.\"\r\n\r\nZhongli releases another long suffering sigh. He rises from his chair and slides past Childe, rearranging the corpse back to its original state and covering it with the sheet. \r\n\r\nIf Childe’s mother ever asks him what they did for their first date, Childe can tell her they spent it surrounded by the romantic atmosphere of mutilated corpses. \r\n\r\n“Let us discuss this elsewhere,” Zhongli says.\r\n\r\nHe leaves no room for argument and abandons Childe in the parlour. The warmth of Liyue’s summer breeze hits Childe as soon as he jogs outside, catching up to the older man. At this time, the harbour is at its busiest, with the voices of merchants drowning each other out in an endless competition to see who can lure their next customer first. \r\n\r\nThis is also the most dangerous time for someone like Zhongli to be walking about. \r\n\r\nAs Childe expected, Zhongli is detained by at least three merchants who convince him to buy their overpriced goods and—to no one’s surprise—Childe is the one who pays. By the time the fourth merchant attempts to call out to Zhongli, Childe literally has to grab the older man’s wrist and drag him away. \r\n\r\nNote to self: Avoid walking around Liyue with Zhongli during business hours. Not because losing Mora is an issue, but because you will literally spend almost two hours waiting for him to decide which shiny object he should add to his collection. \r\n\r\nTwo hours later, they are finally seated in Wanmin Restaurant. It’s a good thing the only people waiting for Zhongli at the funeral parlour are, well, dead because Childe is pretty sure disappearing for that long during your shift is highly frowned upon. \r\n\r\n“As I was saying,” Zhongli says, as if literally two hours had not passed, “we will need to decide on our history. As in how we met, how we fell in love, and so on. If your parents are as… enthusiastic as you describe them to be, then I imagine they will have lots of questions for us.”\r\n\r\nChilde winces. He can already imagine the plethora of questions his mother will ask them. \r\n\r\n“You’re right,” he says, taking a sip of his juice. He rolls the taste in his tongue while thinking through different scenarios. “Hmm… How we met…”\r\n\r\nZhongli waits patiently and watches as Childe taps his fingers on the wooden table. It has to be a story that’s both realistic and exciting enough to satisfy his parents and siblings...\r\n\r\nStruck by sudden genius, Childe sits up and grins at Zhongli. \r\n\r\n“How about this: I was assigned an important, top secret job here in Liyue. As I was getting acquainted with the place, we bumped into each other in the streets and you were kind enough to show me around. For the next several weeks, you would always accompany me everywhere and we became close friends. However, during my top secret mission, I was required to hunt down a powerful lord who sought to endanger the peace of the lands — and lo and behold, to my surprise , it was you. I was blindsided and betrayed! We battled for days and it was one of the greatest battles witnessed in Liyue history, but in the end, I emerged victorious and you surrendered.”\r\n\r\nHe leans back on his chair and raises his eyebrows at Zhongli. They stare at each other for the longest time. \r\n\r\n“Absolutely not,” Zhongli says.\r\n\r\nChilde frowns. “Okay, the battle was very close and you almost won.”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Fine, it was a draw.”\r\n\r\n“No.” Zhongli sighs. “How does that entail that we fell in love in any way?”\r\n\r\n“That comes after obviously. After you surrendered, we fell in love and cast aside our differences. You’re now retired and we’re madly in love with each other. The end.”\r\n\r\nZhongli pinches the bridge of his nose, shaking his head. “I doubt telling your parents that I once ‘sought to endanger the peace of the lands’ will serve as a good first impression for them.”\r\n\r\nHe… has a good point. “Alright, I’ll censor that out,” Childe mutters. He pauses, suddenly remembering another important factor. “If Teucer’s in the room, I’ll have to turn you into a rival toy company owner.”\r\n\r\nThe only thing the ex-Archon does is let out one last sigh of defeat before returning to his own meal. Since Zhongli no longer has anything to say to that, Childe considers he’s won this. Pleased, he falls back to what he usually finds himself doing, and that’s to watch Zhongli perform the most mundane of tasks. Only Zhongli can make drinking soup look like a graceful talent he’s honed for centuries.\r\n\r\nChilde stares down at his own bowl of noodles. He picks up as much as he can with his chopsticks and holds them out towards the ex-Archon. \r\n\r\n“Zhongli-xiansheng, let’s practice being a cute couple,” he says when Zhongli looks up. “Here, let me feed you.”\r\n\r\nHe catches a hint of amusement dancing in Zhongli’s eyes before he leans in, opening his mouth. \r\n\r\nChilde guides the chopsticks to Zhongli’s lips—or he would have if he was actually decent with these things. The noodles escape and slide down onto Zhongli’s lap, all over his custom-made tailored coat. Shit. Getting a stain on Zhongli’s immaculate clothes feels more of a crime than summoning an ancient God back from its slumber to destroy Liyue. \r\n\r\nFortunately, Zhongli chuckles and patiently cleans himself up. Afterwards, he scoops up some of his bamboo shoot soup and holds it out for Childe. \r\n\r\n“Drop the formalities. If we are lovers, we have no need for them,” he says. \r\n\r\nChilde nods, leaning in as Zhongli touches the tip of his spoon to his lips. He can barely focus on the taste when Zhongli’s amber eyes are fixed on him, watching his every move. \r\n\r\n“That’s true…” Childe mutters. “Call me Ajax.”\r\n\r\nZhongli offers another spoonful, tilting his head slightly. “Ajax?”\r\n\r\nChilde is slowly starting to regret suggesting they practice being a couple now. He wasn’t prepared to feel this flustered over Zhongli spoon feeding him soup of all things. \r\n\r\n“That’s my real name. My family are the only ones who still call me by that,” Childe explains once the soup has gone down his throat. He quickly sits back before Zhongli can offer more. “You can call me that when we’re with them.”\r\n\r\n“You do not like the name?” Zhongli asks, sipping a spoonful of his soup. Childe tries, and fails, to not think about how that same spoon has just touched his own lips ten seconds ago.\r\n\r\nHe pushes his noodles around his plate and forces his thoughts to stay on topic… Not that the topic is anything he’d like to be talking about. He’d been away from home so long that he had forgotten what the sound of his real name even sounded like. \r\n\r\n“It doesn’t really feel like it’s me any more,” he explains. \r\n\r\nAjax has long stopped being his real name and more a mask he puts on when he’s with his family. Ajax would have probably gotten married by now, living the domestic life his mother is so excited for him to experience. Ajax wouldn’t be a Harbinger, sugarcoating his adventures to his siblings and passing them off as fairy tales. \r\n\r\nChilde looks up towards the distance where the towering mountains pierce the clouds and wonders what direction will take him back to Snezhnaya. He can hardly remember what his room back home looks like. Even then, he knows, without a doubt, that his mother keeps it clean for him to return to, however long that will take. \r\n\r\n“Ajax would have stayed at home with his family, but I’m Childe now. Tartaglia,” he says. “I can’t go home until…”\r\n\r\nChilde’s voice trails away into silence. Until what? Until the Tsaritsa reaches her goal? He lets out a low laugh and shakes his head, shoving that train of thought away. Now’s not the best time to bring that up, especially with Zhongli of all people. \r\n\r\nWhen they finish their lunch, Childe automatically reaches for his bag of Mora while Zhongli gathers his purchases from earlier. The weather today is particularly humid; Childe can feel his clothes clinging onto him, making him yearn for the refreshing bite of Snezhnaya’s frozen breeze. And yet, Zhongli, who is dressed head to toe in several layers, doesn’t seem bothered at all. \r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t know what possesses him to lean in, enough that he catches a faint scent of the incense that was so overwhelming in the funeral parlour but pleasant when it’s on Zhongli. It’s only when Zhongli looks up that Childe realises he’s so close he can see his luminescent pupils dilate. The sounds of Wanmin Restaurant’s lunch time rush is nothing but a hush compared to the thoughts urging Childe to close the distance between them. \r\n\r\n“Practice,” Childe breathes out, because that’s the only explanation as to why he’s suddenly leaning in and brushing his lips against Zhongli’s cheek. He remains there for a few seconds, listening to the sound of his own pulse rampaging, allowing the smell of incense to fill his head. It takes everything in him to pull away. “Just practice.”\r\n\r\nNeither of them move. Childe is still close enough that he can see how thick Zhongli’s eyelashes are, how they cast shadows along the neat stroke of his eyeliner. Close enough that he sees Zhongli’s mouth parting, the tip of his tongue darting out to lick his bottom lip. \r\n\r\nHe wonders if that was enough practice. Maybe he should…\r\n\r\n“Are you two—?!” \r\n\r\nA startled gasp yanks Childe back to the present. He jerks back, spinning around to see Xiangling staring at both of them with eyes as wide as the sweltering sun. \r\n\r\n“Sorry, I couldn’t help but see...” She madly motions her arms between them, practically vibrating on the spot. “Oh, finally! I was beginning to wonder if it was ever going to happen!”\r\n\r\nWhat… was going to happen? Confused, Childe can only let out a nervous laugh, turning to Zhongli. \r\n\r\n“Yes, Xiangling,” Zhongli slowly says. “We are… happily together.”\r\n\r\nXiangling claps her hands as if this is the best news she’s heard in a long time. What makes it even more strange is that she calls over her father, who congratulates Childe by slamming a hand on his back so hard Childe is convinced that was a declaration for battle. \r\n\r\n“I’m happy for both of you! Xiangling and I knew it was only a matter of time before the two of you became a couple!” Chef Mao tells them. His loud voice booms throughout Chihu Rock, basically telling everyone the apparently good news. “Let me give you a discount to celebrate!”\r\n\r\nWell… if he’s getting a discount out of this, then Childe’s not complaining. The majority of Liyue may be convinced he murdered Rex Lapis, and seeing him with one of their most handsome bachelors is probably the last thing anyone wants—but hey, a discount is a discount. He happily pays for the meal and laughs it off when Xiangling jokes about inviting her to the wedding. \r\n\r\nSeriously, why is everyone obsessed with jumping straight into marriage here?\r\n\r\n“If Xiangling’s fallen for it, then I say we’re already pretty good at this fake lovers thing,” Childe says, grinning at Zhongli. \r\n\r\n“Hmm.” Zhongli doesn’t meet his gaze. He simply nods, and the two of them fall into silence as they walk back to the funeral parlour. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter Zhongli returned to the funeral parlour, Childe spent the rest of the day sorting through matters at the Northland Bank; just some loans that needed chasing here and there, a few people he had to threaten. Nothing out of the ordinary. \r\n\r\nIt’s quiet when he returns to his apartment. Had it not been for the sight of Teucer’s toys cluttering his hallway, he’d have probably forgotten his family are still here. Sighing, Childe picks each toy up, reminding himself to tell his little brother to take better care of them. Honestly, this kid… Childe sends him a crate full of new toys every month and he treats them like this? No wonder most of them are either lost or broken within a week!\r\n\r\nHe follows the toys to his lounge, pausing in his tracks as soon as he finds his parents resting on the couch. Childe’s face relaxes into a genuine smile. Both of them are asleep; his mother is curled up by his father’s side, who is quietly snoring while still holding the book he was likely in the middle of reading. \r\n\r\nAs quietly as he can, Childe sets down Teucer’s toys on the couch and reaches for the nearby blanket. He drapes it over his parents, holding his breath to make sure he makes no sound at all. \r\n\r\nEven so, the agility of the eleventh Harbinger is no match at all for his parents. His father peaks open one eye and lets out a big yawn.\r\n\r\n“Ajax,” he says, voice still thick with sleep. “Welcome back.”\r\n\r\nChilde offers him a sheepish smile and smooths the edges of the blanket over them, taking care not to wake his mother up. “I’m home. Sorry I woke you up. Is everyone already asleep?”\r\n\r\nHis father nods, rubbing his eyes. Under the dim light of the fireplace, Childe can see the harsh lines of age all over his face, coupled with scars he’d gotten from when he still used to hunt.\r\n\r\nWhen he was younger, Childe compared his father to the warriors in the bedtime stories he loved to hear before he went to bed. In a way, he’d gotten his habit of exaggerating stories from him, transforming reality into adventures, the mundane into legends. Now that he’s older, he knows the stories are just stories, and his father is just his father; no longer the warrior little Ajax saw him as. \r\n\r\nIt’s a bit unnerving, really; how age can change someone so drastically. \r\n\r\nOr, how he’s been away from home for so long that the difference is alarming him to this degree. \r\n\r\n“You should sleep soon too; you look tired,” his father says. “Don’t stay up too late.”\r\n\r\nChilde almost laughs at that. He’s in his early twenties and his father is still treating him like a kid—even funnier that, out of everyone in their family, it’s his father who knows just how bad Childe’s battlelust can get. He was the one who sent him to the Fatui, after all. \r\n\r\n“I won’t, I won’t,” Childe lies straight through his teeth. “You too, Father. Go back to sleep. We don’t want your headaches to return.”\r\n\r\nHe leaves his parents by the lounge and makes his way back to his chambers. As soon as he steps inside, he’s drained of what little energy he has left and wastes no time changing into his evening robes. There’s a few letters by his desk that he hasn’t opened yet, but none of them look urgent; Childe can leave those for another day. Unless they’re from his family or the Tsaritsa, then Childe rarely bothers to write back to anyone.\r\n\r\nHe’s just sinking into the warm confines of his blanket when he hears a faint noise by his doorway. Childe sits up and squints, barely making out three small figures hidden in the darkness. \r\n\r\n“Teucer? Anthon? Tonia…?” Childe rubs his eyes. Sure enough, the three of them emerge from the shadows one by one. “Why are you three still awake? You should be asleep!”\r\n\r\nTonia fiddles with the end of her braid; a habit Childe can see she still hasn’t abandoned. “Sorry, Brother… I… We were wondering if…” Her voice wanders off and she turns to her younger brothers. Teucer and Anthon nod encouragingly at her. “If you could tell us a story like you used to…”\r\n\r\nAll traces of drowsiness leave Childe within an instant. \r\n\r\n“You used to do it before…” Anthon mumbles, peeking out from behind Tonia. \r\n\r\nTonia quickly waves her hands. “But if you don’t want to do it anymore then—”\r\n\r\nChilde shakes his head. “Princess, don’t be silly. Of course I still want to do it.” He lifts the blanket and pats the space besides him. “Come here, you three. There’s plenty of room here.”\r\n\r\nThat’s a lie. Even the largest bed offered in Baiju Guesthouse is no match to fit three kids and a grown adult. Childe chuckles and hugs his siblings closer, making sure the blanket covers all of them. \r\n\r\n“Stay quiet though,” he reminds them, tucking a stray piece of Tonia’s hair behind her ear. “Mother and Father won’t be happy to find you all still awake.” \r\n\r\nThe three of them nod enthusiastically. Teucer raises a finger to his lips and Childe grins at him, ruffling his hair. \r\n\r\n“I still can’t believe all of you are here,” he muses. “Who’s looking after our house?”\r\n\r\n“Brother Taras and Sister Anya are there!” Teucer answers.\r\n\r\nSlowly, Childe nods. If he hasn’t seen his parents and younger siblings in a while, then he hasn’t seen Taras and Anya in forever. His older siblings had already moved out by the time Childe was enlisted into the Fatui.\r\n\r\n“Oh yeah, how are they doing?” he asks.\r\n\r\nTonia sits up and hugs one of Childe’s pillows to her chest. “Sister Anya is busy with her research, and Brother Taras recently broke up with his girlfriend.”\r\n\r\nChilde can’t help but laugh at that. “Wasn’t he with that one for several years?”\r\n\r\nShe giggles into her hand. “Yes… He’s not very happy about it. Both of them congratulate you about Mr. Zhongli though!”\r\n\r\nAnthon frowns. “No, Brother Taras said that he doesn’t believe you and that this is all bullshit.”\r\n\r\nTeucer gasps and points at Anthon. “You said a bad word!”\r\n\r\n“No bad words allowed, young man,” Childe says, lightly flicking Anthon on the tip of his nose. \r\n\r\n“Brother Taras said it first!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, well, our older brother is a bad man. We all know I’m the better brother here.”\r\n\r\nAnother lie, of course, because while their older brother is crass and hot-tempered, Childe doubts he’s ever killed anyone. \r\n\r\n“Anyway, enough about that.” Childe pulls his siblings closer and lowers his voice to a whisper. “Now, what story to tell you three… Did I ever tell you about the time I fought a basilisk…”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTeucer and Anthon are asleep before Childe can finish his story. Tonia is snuggled by his side, her eyelids gradually drooping close. Some of her curls have escaped her braid, tickling Childe’s collarbone. He smooths her hair down and lightly pats her head. \r\n\r\n“Tonia, go to sleep now,” Childe urges. \r\n\r\nShe yawns, moving closer to him. “I missed you, Brother.”\r\n\r\nHer voice is barely audible but he hears it enough. Childe twists one of her curls around his finger, sorting through emotions he hadn’t given himself a chance to feel in… ages. There’s no doubt he misses his family; he writes to them as often as he can to fill in the void of leaving home, but work keeps him busy enough to stop himself from brooding. Now that his family has crashed back into his life, he’s nowhere near prepared for all of this. \r\n\r\n“I missed you too,” Childe whispers.\r\n\r\n“I’m happy for you. I hope Mr. Zhongli makes you as happy as you make us, Brother.”\r\n\r\nChilde grits his teeth. All of a sudden, the warmth of his siblings curled around him feels like a giant weight. \r\n\r\n“Go to sleep, Princess,” Childe says. \r\n\r\nWhen he looks down, Tonia has already fallen asleep, but it doesn’t get rid of the bitter thought that Childe almost says out loud. \r\n\r\nSorry your big brother is nothing but a liar. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt’s even warmer the next day, which makes it all the more unbearable that his mother has been staring at this vegetable stall for almost an hour. Childe has resorted to using his hydro vision to cool himself down, but the humidity quickly reminds him that’s useless. Not for the first time in his life, he wishes he’d been gifted with a cryo vision rather than a hydro one. \r\n\r\nHow is his mother surviving? He’s been in Liyue for months and he’s close to melting. Meanwhile, his mother hasn’t even acknowledged the weather, and she’s casually walking around wearing one of her Snezhnayan dresses! Granted, she’s thankfully not wearing her furs anymore, but those dresses are still far too thick for this part of the world. \r\n\r\nHis mother taps him on the shoulder. \r\n\r\n“Ajax, dear, since it’s rather hot, do you think Mr. Zhongli would like okróshka? Or…” She trails off, her eyes travelling to the other side of the stall. “No, perhaps borscht would be better; he might not like cold soup... Oh no, I’m not sure they sell beetroot here… Ajax, what do you think?”\r\n\r\nChilde takes that as his cue to escape. He beams at his mother and places his hands on her shoulders, maneuvering her away from the stall. \r\n\r\n“How about I take care of the soup, and you can make us your famous pirog? I’ve missed it.”\r\n\r\nThey should have enough ingredients back in his apartment for that. No more shopping, please. \r\n\r\nHis mother beams at him and pats his cheek. “Anything for you, dear.”\r\n\r\nJust as Childe thinks they’re done for the day, she walks to the next stall and dashes all of his hopes. Sighing, he gives up and summons more water to splash himself with, running his fingers through his damp hair. \r\n\r\n“I was going to make syrniki for dessert, but that would cause problems if Anthon ate it…” his mother mumbles. \r\n\r\nChilde hears alarm bells ringing inside his head. “Please don’t give him any dairy products while he’s anywhere near my home.”\r\n\r\nHis mother laughs. “I can make tea cakes with cashew milk instead then.”\r\n\r\nCrisis averted, although it does mean they spend another hour in Liyue’s markets looking for more ingredients. Childe is convinced he’s hallucinating by the time he walks past Lumine, soaked from head to toe with lotus leaves stuck to her hair. Paimon waves as soon as she spots him.\r\n\r\n“Childe!” she calls out, flying to his side. \r\n\r\nAs expected, his mother’s attention is torn from the cart of flowers she’d been eyeing. Now, she’s staring at Paimon with a look that can only mean she’s trying not to gawk, but she is definitely gawking. In his mother’s defence, she’s a housewife with no vision; Childe doubts she’s ever seen a hilichurl up close, let alone whatever Paimon is supposed to be.\r\n\r\n“Mother, this is Lumine and Paimon,” Childe says, motioning towards both of them. “They’re my friends.”\r\n\r\nHis mother’s face relaxes into a friendly smile. “Oh, you must be the nice lady Teucer mentioned. It’s lovely to finally meet you. I’m Marisha.”\r\n\r\nShe reaches to shake Lumine’s hand, then stops when she realises Lumine is literally soaked to the bone. Water is still dripping from her clothes and her hair is stuck to her face that Childe can barely see her eyes. \r\n\r\nLumine waves at them with a blank expression. \r\n\r\n“Why do you look like you’ve just jumped down a waterfall?” Childe finally asks. \r\n\r\nLumine shrugs. “As a matter of fact, I did jump down a waterfall.”\r\n\r\nChilde exchanges glances with his mother, who has returned to gawking. \r\n\r\n“Food delivery,” Lumine says, as if that explains everything. “It’s nice to meet you as well, Mrs. Marisha.”\r\n\r\nPaimon swoops down and Childe’s mother lets out a laugh, shaking her small hand. Childe watches them with amusement. Sure, Paimon may look cute and harmless at first, but she’s the literal embodiment of evil. \r\n\r\nHis mother turns back to Lumine and motions towards the large basket of food they’ve gathered today. “We’re having dinner with Ajax’s fiance later—”\r\n\r\n“Mother, we’re not—”\r\n\r\n“—would you like to join us?”\r\n\r\nChilde swears he sees the corners of Lumine’s lips quirk up. On the other hand, Paimon is already snickering into her hands, kicking her legs about in the air. Childe imagines himself throwing her across the harbour to satisfy his growing urge for violence. \r\n\r\n“Um, I’m a bit busy tonight… Perhaps next time?” Lumine says.\r\n\r\nChilde’s mother nods. “That’s okay, dear. You’re always welcome any time. You too, Paimon.”\r\n\r\nThe only way Paimon will ever be invited for dinner at Childe’s house is if they end up serving her. Even then, Childe would rather avoid that, despite how many times Lumine has made the same joke about her being emergency food. \r\n\r\nLumine tucks her wet hair behind her ears and actually smirks at him. Childe is literally at a loss for words. “Enjoy yourselves, though. Ajax, tell Mr. Zhongli I said hello.”\r\n\r\nPaimon surges to his side and smacks him on the back. “And congratulations on the engagement!”\r\n\r\n“We’re not—”\r\n\r\nThe two of them dash off before he can finish his sentence. Childe massages his temples and takes two deep breaths. He never should have told Lumine and Paimon about Zhongli. They’re never going to let him live this down. \r\n\r\n“They seem nice,” his mother tells him. \r\n\r\nChilde has enough energy to fake a smile. Today is going to be a long day. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen he hears a knock, Childe moves at record-breaking speed. He opens the door before Zhongli can knock a second time. \r\n\r\nHe’s prepared himself for this. They’ve cooked enough food to feed half of Liyue Harbour, and he’s gone through every romantic scenario in his head to please his parents. If all goes according to plan, then maybe tonight will be enough to convince his parents he’s found the love of his life and they can spend the rest of their two-week stay here simply being tourists. Is that too much to ask for?\r\n\r\nPrepared as he may be, Childe is not prepared to be greeted by a giant bouquet of flowers taller than his head. \r\n\r\n“For you,” Zhongli says, pushing the bouquet to him. One of the flowers almost pokes Childe in the eye. He dodges in the nick of time and peers at Zhongli through the stems. \r\n\r\n“Thanks…” Childe says, weighing the bouquet in his arms. How did Zhongli even pay for this? \r\n\r\n“The ferrylady suggested I bring this with me… I must admit I asked her for advice when meeting your family,” Zhongli explains, clearly aware of the direction of Childe\'s thoughts. \r\n\r\nHe looks at Childe in the eyes before ducking in and pressing his lips to his cheeks, essentially causing the Harbinger’s brain to implode. Childe’s now glad he’s carrying the world’s heaviest bouquet of flowers; it stops him from pressing his hand against the cheek Zhongli kissed like the lovestruck teenager he’s suddenly regressed into.\r\n\r\nBut enough about that—Zhongli asked the ferrylady for relationship advice? Childe would give anything to see that.\r\n\r\n“These are beautiful,” Childe say, hoping to Tsaritsa that he\'s actually got a vase in his apartment to put these flowers in. “You ready?”\r\n\r\nZhongli nods. Right on time, Childe’s mother pops her head into the corridor.\r\n\r\n“Ajax, I heard the door—oh!” She straightens as soon as she catches sight of Zhongli. \r\n\r\nZhongli steps forward, bowing. “You must be Ajax’s mother. I’m—”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Zhongli!” Childe’s mother rushes to them, all but pulling Zhongli into one of her bone-crushing hugs.\r\n\r\nChilde stands back, both amused and horrified. It’s only when he sees Zhongli struggling to decide whether he should hug her back or not that he decides he’s definitely more amused.\r\n\r\n“Oh Tsaritsa, Ajax never mentioned how handsome you are!\" his mother gushes. \"No wonder he talks nonstop about you in his letters!”\r\n\r\nNever mind. Now he’s just horrified. \r\n\r\n“Mother—”\r\n\r\n“Gavriil! Children!” Childe’s mother calls out. “Mr. Zhongli is here!”\r\n\r\nAll at once, four redheads pour into the corridor and crowd around Zhongli. Childe is pushed into the corner, but he’s more than happy to let Zhongli take this spotlight. \r\n\r\nHe’ll give him some credit though; from the outside, Zhongli is calm and polite, offering smiles to each and every one of his family members—but Childe’s been around the ex-Archon enough to notice the small changes in his body language. Zhongli’s shoulders are stiff. He’s way out of his comfort zone. Poor thing. \r\n\r\nChilde leans against the wall and pretends to be too busy admiring his gigantic bouquet. He’ll rescue his fake lover in a bit. \r\n\r\n“I’m Marisha, and this is my husband, Gavriil,” Childe’s mother says. She motions to the children, who are all dressed in their best clothes. “The youngest is Teucer, followed by Anthon, and then Tonia.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of their names, Childe’s siblings flock around Zhongli, all speaking over each other. Childe only manages to hear Anthon ask Zhongli if he eats rocks for breakfast.\r\n\r\nLaughing, Childe swoops in to the rescue. He takes Zhongli by the hand and pulls him back to his side. “Let’s not crowd around him… Ahaha, it’s getting too claustrophobic in here.”\r\n\r\nTeucer tilts his head. “What does claws-straw-phoby mean?”\r\n\r\n“Claustrophobic, dummy,” Anthon huffs. “It means a fear of spaces that are too cramped and squishy!”\r\n\r\n“I’m not scared!” Teucer squints at Zhongli. “Is Mr. Zhongli scared?”\r\n\r\nChilde gently pushes his siblings out of the cramped hallway. “No, he’s not, but it’s better if we all sit down.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a pleasure to finally meet all of you. Ajax talks about his family all the time,” Zhongli says once all of them are sitting in the lounge.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, Childe did have a vase to put his flowers in. They look out of place in his bare apartment, but he likes them. \r\n\r\nHearing his real name, Childe averts his eyes from the flowers and fakes a smile towards his family. He’ll have to get used to Zhongli calling him Ajax. \r\n\r\n“Brother talks about you in his letters a lot too!” Anthon speaks up. “It’s always Zhongli this, Zhongli that—”\r\n\r\nChilde’s smile drops. “Anthon.”\r\n\r\nHis father lets out a low, hearty laugh. “We were all so shocked when we found out Ajax was getting married—”\r\n\r\n“Father, I told you that we’re not—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you’re considering marriage in the future, are you not?” Childe’s mother asks. Her eyes are so wide and full of hope that Childe can’t bring himself to deny her. “Mr. Zhongli, I hope you know what you’re getting into! Ajax is a lot of trouble.”\r\n\r\nZhongli turns to Childe. The softness in his eyes catches him off guard and he can only gawk as Zhongli smiles at him. \r\n\r\n“I’ve grown to like it,” Zhongli says, delivering another critical hit. \r\n\r\nChilde sits back, breathing deep. Zhongli is really good at this acting thing. He might even convince Childe at this point. \r\n\r\nThat should be a reassuring thing; the fact both of them are able to act so well it convinces everyone straight away. For some reason, though, Childe is unable to understand why it feels like there’s something… unpleasant clawing at his chest. \r\n\r\nIt… It doesn’t matter. Now’s not the best time to be brooding. \r\n\r\nHe averts his gaze away from Zhongli and claps his hands together, standing up. “Should we prepare dinner?”\r\n\r\nHis mother rises with him. “Yes! Mr. Zhongli, we’ve prepared a few Snezhnayan dishes; I hope that’s okay?”\r\n\r\n“I look forward to it.”\r\n\r\n“Brother also made his best soup!” Tonia adds. “Wait until you see it! It’s amazing!”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure it is.” Zhongli gives him that smile again. \r\n\r\nChilde is beginning to doubt he’ll ever survive this dinner. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChilde is… confused, to say the least. They’ve just sat down for dinner, and all of the dishes are laid out as neatly as possible. There’s so much food that Childe is sure they will be well fed for the entire week, assuming it doesn’t go stale. His mother cooked Snezhnayan dishes for the main meal and for dessert, but Childe was in charge of the soup. He decided he would make something Zhongli should be familiar with, if only to give them some variety. \r\n\r\nSo, why in the Abyss is Zhongli staring at his calla lily seafood soup like he’s seconds away from lunging across the table and attacking it?\r\n\r\nAfter what seems like an entire minute of Zhongli staring at the soup enough to pierce a hole through it, Childe slowly scoops some into his bowl, offering him one of the largest tentacles. It falls into the soup with a quiet plop. Zhongli looks up at him with so much intensity that Childe almost takes the bowl away. \r\n\r\nThey give thanks to their meal and begin eating. From the corner of his eyes, Childe watches Zhongli raise his spoon to his lips. \r\n\r\n“...How’s the soup?” he asks under his breath. \r\n\r\n“Wonderful,” Zhongli says far, far too quickly that Childe knows he’s lying. \r\n\r\nNote to self: Never cook for Zhongli ever again. \r\n\r\n“Dear, here’s some pirog,” Childe’s mother says. She cuts a slice for Zhongli and slides it onto his plate. \r\n\r\n“Thank you. Is it a pie?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. It’s stuffed with cabbage and chicken.”\r\n\r\nZhongli pops a small piece into his mouth and closes his eyes. After a while, he nods. “It tastes lovely. The dough is so soft, it feels as though it is melting in my mouth.”\r\n\r\nChilde grins. “Ah, yes. Mother’s an expert at making pirog. You can\'t imagine how much I\'ve missed eating this.”\r\n\r\n“You boys flatter me too much…” His mother waves a hand to brush their compliments off, though Childe can tell she may as well be glowing from them. \r\n\r\n“So, Mr. Zhongli…” Shit. Childe knows that tone. He braces himself, waiting for the inevitable questions his mother was bound to unleash. “Ajax has told us so much about you, but I don’t believe he’s ever revealed how you two met…”\r\n\r\nHe takes a deep breath. He’s already thought of an answer to this—\r\n\r\n“We began as business partners,” Zhongli answers before he can get a word in.  “I had only thought of Ajax as a work colleague, but I admit his… eccentricities intrigued me and I sought to spend more time with him.”\r\n\r\nChilde blinks. That’s… not the story they agreed on. \r\n\r\n“At first, I wished to understand what made him different from everyone else, but as time passed, I found myself enjoying his company to the point where my days feel empty if he is not by my side.” Zhongli tilts his head towards him, resting his chin on his hands with a gentle smile. Childe can only stare back with wide eyes. He doesn’t even realise he’s dropped his spoon until he hears it clattering to the floor. “I am very much fond of him. He fills my days with a joy I have not felt in a long while.”\r\n\r\nWell… Fuck. Childe swallows the dry lump in his throat.\r\n\r\nZhongli is… really too good at this. \r\n\r\nAnthon fakes the sound of vomiting, quickly dispelling any sort of romantic atmosphere Zhongli has managed to create. Childe is unsure whether he’s grateful or not for this. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, his mother looks like she’s about to cry any moment now. She reaches for a napkin and dabs the corner of her eyes, muttering something about ‘young love’. \r\n\r\nIf only she knew Zhongli is literally over six thousand years old. \r\n\r\n“Brother, you\'re almost as red as your hair!” Teucer cries out, pointing at Childe. \r\n\r\nTonia giggles. “He’s right!”\r\n\r\nOf course, pointing this out only makes things worse. Childe prays for the ground to swallow him whole, a bit like that time he fell straight through a crack in the forest and landed in the Abyss. Now would be a good time for that to happen again. \r\n\r\n“Ajax blushing… Now there\'s something I didn\'t think I\'d ever witness,” his father says, clearly impressed. Sure, because his father’s witnessed him almost murder twenty men when he was fourteen, but the sight of Childe blushing is what amazes him. \r\n\r\nAnthon joins in with Teucer pointing at Childe’s apparently red face. “He\'s in loooooove!”\r\n\r\nWhy did Childe think this was a good idea? This is only the first day. Does that mean he has to put up with thirteen more days of this? \r\n\r\n“Wow, all of you are really doing your best to embarrass me in front of Zhongli…” he mumbles, having lost nearly all of his will to live. He doesn’t even want to look at how Zhongli is reacting to this. If he’s lucky then maybe Zhongli will think he’s acting as well. \r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, you know we\'re only jesting,” his mother reassures him, ruffling his hair.  \r\n\r\nAs if choosing to have mercy on him, his parents change the topic by asking Zhongli more questions about himself. Thankfully, most of these are only basic questions about Zhongli’s job, his hobbies, how long he’s been in Liyue for… Zhongli answers all of them with no trouble at all, and it’s not long until Childe’s parents are charmed—as with anyone who comes into contact with the god. \r\n\r\nChilde allows their voices to fade into the background once Anthon starts asking Zhongli about what his favourite books are. He can’t help but think back to what Zhongli told his parents.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn’t be any surprise that Zhongli is so good at pretending to be his lover. After all, he did deceive Childe from the very beginning. For someone who comes across as graceful and polite, Childe forgets Zhongli can be as equally cunning and ruthless when he wants to be. \r\n\r\nChilde pushes his plate away and rises from the table. “I’m going to get dessert prepared. Excuse me.”\r\n\r\nHe doesn’t wait for them to respond, although he feels the unmistakable weight of Zhongli’s gaze following him. As soon as he’s in the kitchen, he lets out a deep sigh and almost hits himself for the stupid thoughts running through his head. \r\n\r\nNo, no, this is to be expected. He hates having to resort to deceit; he should have known he’d eventually feel like this. Besides, it was his idea to pretend to be Zhongli’s lover; Zhongli is only doing what their contract required him to do. \r\n\r\nHe’ll get used to this. He just needs… practice. Childe smirks, shaking his head to himself. How the tables turn…\r\n\r\nThe sound of footsteps pull Childe away from his musings. He’s not surprised to find Zhongli in the kitchen when he turns around. \r\n\r\n“Is everything okay?” Zhongli asks. \r\n\r\nChilde plasters a smile on his face. “I should be asking you that. They’re not too much, are they? My family can get very excitable.”\r\n\r\nZhongli runs his finger along the smooth surface of the counter. Even amidst the chaos Childe’s mother left in this kitchen, Zhongli manages to look regal, every bit the god he once was. \r\n\r\n“It’s nothing I cannot handle,” Zhongli says. “You have a lovely family.”\r\n\r\n“I know. I’ve missed them a lot.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not see them often?”\r\n\r\nChilde shakes his head and leans against the counter, folding his arms. “Not since I joined the Fatui. I regularly write to them though, especially Tonia.”\r\n\r\nZhongli remains where he’s standing at the other side of the kitchen. The distance between them may as well be miles away. Childe doesn’t like the way Zhongli looks at him as if he’s walking on eggshells. He forces out a half-hearted smirk. \r\n\r\n“Your story about how we met… That was some impressive acting,” Childe says. “Even I almost believed you for a second there.”\r\n\r\nZhongli looks down. “I’m glad it pleases you.”\r\n\r\nChilde isn’t sure how to respond to that. He settles for nodding, and quickly decides that wasn’t a good response at all because now they’ve fallen into silence that’s painfully awkward. He taps his foot against the tiles, wincing at how that only emphasises the lack of conversation between them. \r\n\r\n“Was my soup that bad?” he asks, desperate to break this tension. \r\n\r\nTo his surprise, there’s evident distress on Zhongli’s face. He offers Childe an apologetic smile. “Ah, yes. About that… I… I am not fond of seafood. I find the texture and the smell unpleasant, but once cut properly, I can appreciate it. Your soup itself was appetizing. Forgive me if my reaction offended you.”\r\n\r\nChilde manages to stop himself from laughing just in time. Zhongli, immovable and cold as rock, distressed by something so insignificant as seafood. It’s almost endearing. \r\n\r\n“You know, for a second there, I almost thought you were going to drop a meteor at the dinner table.\"\r\n\r\n“I considered it for a brief second, yes.”\r\n\r\nNow, Childe is unable to stop himself from laughing. “I think my parents adore you so much that they would have been impressed by that.”\r\n\r\nThey settle back into silence, but it’s no longer as unbearably awkward as it was earlier. Childe motions over his shoulder towards the food and drinks still on the counter. “We should get back. Would you mind carrying the drinks while I bring the dessert?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not.”\r\n\r\nZhongli walks across the kitchen. Childe is about to turn around to give him the drinks when he spots one of Teucer’s toys on the floor—\r\n\r\nAaand he doesn’t manage to warn Zhongli before he trips over it. Childe lurches forward, catching Zhongli in time. Or that was the plan. \r\n\r\nHe gulps, staring straight into the ex-Archon’s eyes. Somehow, they’ve ended up with Zhongli pinning him to the counter, and Childe, who had tried to grab Zhongli before he fell, manages to grab his ass instead. \r\n\r\n“Shit. Sorry, Teucer’s always leaving his toys all over the…” \r\n\r\nChilde shuts up as soon as his nose accidentally brushes against Zhongli’s. He’s so close he can literally feel his breath on his lips. \r\n\r\nFuck. \r\n\r\nShit. \r\n\r\nChilde loses any form of coherent thought. All he can do is stand there, gawking at Zhongli and trying his best not to pay attention to the fact his lips are dangerously close and it’ll only take one move for them to close that distance—\r\n\r\n“Brother, is the dessert ready yet—AH!” Tonia’s shrill scream pierces through the fog in Childe’s brain. He snaps out of it enough to see her covering her eyes, spinning around so fast she almost trips over her own feet. “I-I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to interrupt!” \r\n\r\nShe runs off, most likely scarred for life. Childe should be horrified that his beloved sister has witnessed something like this, but all of the events from today are catching up to him. The only thing he can do is laugh into Zhongli’s neck. He lets out a weak chuckle and closes his eyes, breathing in the soothing scent of incense. \r\n\r\nFuck. He really can\'t think anymore.\r\n\r\nPossessed by Celestia knows what, Childe traces the tip of his nose along Zhongli’s neck. He waits for any sign of resistance, for Zhongli to push him away and tell him to stop, remind him there’s no one here and they don’t need to act, not right now. He doesn’t. Zhongli is as still as a statue, but Childe can see from the corner of his eyes that he grips the counter tighter. \r\n\r\nHe should stop. He should pull away and laugh it off. They don’t need to be doing this now.\r\n\r\nPractice, he reminds himself as his lips move on their own accord, pressing against the smooth column of Zhongli’s neck. He hears the ex-Archon breathe in. Childe stills, waiting for that sign to force him to finally stop. \r\n\r\nZhongli’s hand pushes against the back of his head, keeping him in place.\r\n\r\nIt’s nothing, Childe repeats again and again, until it’s the only thought that runs through his head and keeps him grounded. Nothing, nothing. Nothing. He slides his lips along Zhongli’s neck, pressing closer when he feels fingers carding through his hair. Nothing. He sucks just under Zhongli’s jaw and listens to the sharp hiss that follows soon after. Nothing. Zhongli tilts his head; a silent invitation for more when they should be stopping, they shouldn’t be doing this. It’s nothing. Childe kisses up the edge of his jaw, his chin, the corner of his lips, and—\r\n\r\n“Ajax? Is everything okay?”\r\n\r\nChilde jolts back. At the same time, Zhongli throws himself off him so fast that he’s at the other side of the kitchen within the blink of an eye. \r\n\r\n“Dear, is the dessert not ready yet?” Childe’s mother asks, peering into the kitchen door. She looks between him and Zhongli, raising her eyebrows. \r\n\r\nChilde quickly turns to the counter, reaching for the dessert they’ve clearly forgotten. Next to him, Zhongli gathers the drinks, and Childe makes the mistake of looking at him. His eyes immediately land on the red mark that’s slowly blooming on the ex-Archon\'s neck. \r\n\r\nGreat. Fucking great. He’s gone and given Zhongli a motherfucking hickey right in the middle of dinner. As if it wasn’t already obvious what they’ve been doing here. \r\n\r\n“Everything’s fine,” Childe tells his mother, who clearly does not believe anything that’s coming out of his mouth. “Everything’s just fine.”', 'set_in_stone.jpg', '2021-04-25 21:45:52.801524', '2021-04-26 10:15:23.514063', '0', '1', 'set_in_stone_02', '1', '2', 'Set in Stone');

He ducks down in time, hearing the hiss of a blade narrowly miss his cheek, and kicks the treasure hoarder right in the chest. It takes them a second to regain their balance, but one second is all it takes for him to drive his blade into their gut.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t kiss him,” Childe says, shooting her a quick glare as the treasure hoarder flails in his arms. He twists the blade deeper, aiming under their ribs, and smirks when they finally go limp. \r\n\r\nThere’s no time for a smug victory though. Just as he drops the body and summons his hydro blades away, another treasure hoarder is charging towards him with a shovel of all things. He jumps back and aims with his bow, firing an arrow straight into their… shoulder. Drat. He meant to aim for their neck, but that’s close enough. He fires another shot and, thankfully, that hits home. The large man collapses into the snow.\r\n\r\n“You were slurping up his neck! You gave him a hickey!” he hears Paimon yelling.\r\n\r\n“And you grabbed his ass,” Lumine adds.\r\n\r\nBefore Childe can defend himself against those ghastly accusations, the rest of the treasure hoarders decide it’s a good idea to rush towards him. He happily brandishes his blades again and meets them halfway. The more time passes, the harsher the bite of the snowstorm. He grits his teeth through the cold and lets adrenaline keep him warm. \r\n\r\nIt doesn’t take long to get rid of the remaining hoarders. Half of them panic and scamper away, tripping in the snow like babies who had just learnt how to walk. If Childe wasn’t close to freezing his balls off, he’d have chased after them to finish the job. \r\n\r\nSighing, he calls his blades away and squats down, sifting through the corpses’ belongings. The sight of blood seeping into snow is a sight he has not seen in far, far too long.\r\n\r\nThere was always something so beautiful about the sight of vibrant crimson tarnishing the pure white valleys of his homeland. Come the next morning, a new blanket of snow would cover everything from the previous day. No matter how ghastly the scene, how thick the blood had soaked its surroundings, Snezhnayan snowstorms are always harsher. It is, after all, the last and most dangerous enemy you will ever face in the harsh lands of Snezhnaya. \r\n\r\nHe’s always found comfort in it. Regardless of how far his family was, he knew they would be back home surrounded by that unchanging snow. He’d chosen the chaotic life of the Harbingers rather than remain at home with them, but he liked to cling onto useless sentiments such as this.\r\n\r\nA sudden gust of freezing wind pulls Childe away from his thoughts. He braces himself and returns to the task at hand. He’s been hanging around Zhongli too much; the ex-Archon’s penchant for nostalgia is rubbing off on him. \r\n\r\nHe returns to searching the corpses, although it’s not long until he sees there’s not much to find. For a group that calls themselves treasure hoarders, Childe barely sees any treasure at all; just a handful of Mora and some insignias. \r\n\r\nLumine crouches down, warming her hands by the campfire the treasure hoarders kindly left behind. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter what you did. The fact is that you enjoyed it.”\r\n\r\nChilde sits opposite her, throwing all of the Mora and insignias in Paimon’s direction. The flames of the campfire dance between them as Lumine stares at him, waiting for him to deny it. He almost does, but then she raises an eyebrow and all he can do is look away and grumble to himself.\r\n\r\n“It’s just a natural reaction. This whole fake lovers agreement is messing with my head.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that exactly?”\r\n\r\nHe shrugs, drawing circles along the snow with his finger. Snow seeps into his gloves and it almost feels like he’s back home. He gathers a handful and crushes it into his palm, allowing the ice to numb his skin while he struggles to think of an answer.\r\n\r\n“Zhongli is… really good at acting. It’s easy to get lost in it.”\r\n\r\nLast night, he thought about it in bed far longer than he should have. The memory was so vivid that he could still taste Zhongli’s skin and hear the sharp breaths he took when Childe slid his lips along his neck. Childe wondered, for a brief second, what other noises Zhongli would have made if he’d bit down, hard. Curiosity tugged at the corner of his brain; it yearned to know the ranges of Zhongli’s expressions, his reactions, anything outside of his normal, stoic shell. \r\n\r\nAnd then Childe stopped there, literally slapping himself out of it before he could go too far. One day into this stupid contract and he was already making this more difficult than it had to be. \r\n\r\nChilde glances up and catches Lumine and Paimon looking at each other. Their expressions make it look like they know something he doesn’t. \r\n\r\n“I think what you need to ask yourself is if you would have reacted like this if you were faking a relationship with someone else instead,” Lumine says after a while.\r\n\r\nChilde can only frown at that. \r\n\r\nPaimon bobs in the air, waving a finger. “As in, would you be falling for the act if you faked a relationship with Venti instead?”\r\n\r\nShe points at the bard Childe has completely forgotten about. The bard strums his lyre from the fence he’s been sitting on all this time. He didn’t even help them fight the treasure hoarders. All he’s been doing is provide background music. \r\n\r\n“We literally just met today,” Childe says. \r\n\r\nAccording to Paimon’s babble, Venti was the Anemo Archon whose gnosis was stolen by La Signora. For some reason, he didn’t even so much as bat an eyelid when he found out Childe was another Harbinger. A shame, because Childe wouldn’t have minded a fight, although this guy doesn’t look like he’ll be much of a challenge. \r\n\r\nWhen La Signora mentioned stealing the Anemo Archon’s gnosis, Childe didn’t expect it would come from a bard who spoke with rhymes every five seconds. \r\n\r\n“You’re giving Morax too much credit,” Venti says, his voice sounding like a song. “That buffoon wouldn’t be able to act even if you offered him a million Mora.”\r\n\r\n“How did Zhongli even react when you slurped up his neck?” Paimon asks. \r\n\r\n“Can you please stop saying it like that?” Childe scowls at her. “He didn’t… do anything. He just stayed there.”\r\n\r\nPaimon shrugs. “Maybe he liked it.”\r\n\r\nChilde groans. He is not about to have this conversation with Paimon of all people.\r\n\r\n“Like I said, it’s a normal reaction. I dived into this fake relationship thing without thinking about it, so I just… got carried away. It won’t happen again. Not unless we need to fake a few kisses in front of my family but they won’t be anything like… like that. ”\r\n\r\nIt’s what makes the most sense in his head. Zhongli is a very attractive man, and he’s also one of the few people Childe can consider a friend. Of course his body is going to have some sort of positive reaction to him… Besides, it’s completely natural for a man of his age to react like that. He’s young, he’s got raging hormones! It’s normal!\r\n\r\nLumine clears her throat. “You still didn’t answer my question.”\r\n\r\n“What question?”\r\n\r\n“Would you have reacted like this if you faked a relationship with someone else instead?”\r\n\r\n“Yes…?” Childe trails off with a frown. Well… no, if he did this with Lumine instead, he doesn’t think it would have been the same. She’s practically a sister to him. “I don’t know—I mean, yes. Yeah?”\r\n\r\nLumine and Paimon don’t look convinced. To be honest, Childe doesn’t think he’s convinced himself either—but it’s not like he knows anyone else he can fake a relationship with. Aside from Zhongli and Lumine, he’s only ever around the other Harbingers, and there’s no way that could be an option. He can’t even stand being in the same room as the rest of the Harbingers, let alone spending two weeks pretending to be in love with any of them. \r\n\r\nVenti joins them, setting aside his lyre to warm his hands by the campfire. “How’s Morax doing these days? Or, well, I guess he’s calling himself Zhongli now.”\r\n\r\nChilde is grateful for the change of topic. “He works as a consultant in Wangsheng Funeral Parlour now. Don’t really know why he’s still working when I’m the one who ends up paying for him all the time.”\r\n\r\nLumine shuffles closer to the fire and shivers when a gust of wind barrels through them. Childe doesn’t understand why she insisted on exploring this barren mountain of ice, and moreover, why she decided to explore without wearing adequate clothes. He certainly hopes she doesn’t intend on going to Snezhnaya in that sleeveless dress of hers. \r\n\r\n“Venti, you and Zhongli knew each other when you were Archons, didn’t you? He mentioned he had a friend who always gave him dandelion wine,” Lumine says once she’s stopped shivering. \r\n\r\n“He called me a friend? That’s a surprise.”\r\n\r\nPaimon nods. “He also called you a disgrace to the arts.”\r\n\r\nAt this, the bard throws his head back and laughs. “Yeah, we knew each other before but he was no fun. He never smiled, not even when he was around that woman.”\r\n\r\n“Woman?” Paimon scratches her head. “What woman?”\r\n\r\n“The Goddess of Dust. Guizhong.”\r\n\r\nChilde squints at the fire, vaguely recognising the name. All he knows is that she was a Goddess who worked alongside Zhongli—or Morax, as he had once been called—but ultimately died during the Archon War. \r\n\r\nHe’s never given it much thought. Sometimes, it’s all too easy to forget Zhongli was a god. When he’s with Zhongli, he doesn’t think of him as the ex-Archon who ruled over Liyue for thousands of years. Even when he was searching for the gnosis, it never occurred to him that Zhongli could be anything more than a man who simply knew too much about Liyue. \r\n\r\n“Oh, Paimon’s heard about the Goddess of Dust! Lumine met this researcher who knew all about her! She said she was Rex Lapis’ ally and best friend, and that she complimented his brawns with her brains. Wasn’t the Guili Plains named after them?”\r\n\r\nVenti strums his lyre. “That’s right. They were always together, even until she died.”\r\n\r\nChilde pokes a stick into the campfire, watching the flames until they morph into a blur of amber, scarlet, and gold. They were always together, even until she died. It’s the worst time for the little voice in his head to pop up, wondering if, maybe, the reason why he doesn’t think about Zhongli being an ex-Archon is because it reminds him of the differences between them. Childe’s own lifespan may as well be minuscule seconds compared to the countless centuries Zhongli has lived through. It\'s nothing. It’s a blink of an eye against an eternity.\r\n\r\nHe grinds his teeth together, throwing the branch into the flames. Vaguely, he hears Venti singing a song as the howling winds of Dragonspine join in. He can’t bring himself to appreciate it. \r\n\r\nChilde inhales, exhales, watching his breath puff out into the unforgiving breeze. He really is getting far too sentimental for his own good.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter Lumine almost freezes to death in Dragonspine, Childe manages to convince her to call it quits for the day. He also urges her to wear appropriate clothes next time; running around trying to find the nearest torch or campfire every five minutes gets boring very, very quickly. \r\n\r\nChilde is craving for a nice, warm bath when he returns to Liyue, but, as luck would have it, his parents have other plans. \r\n\r\n“We’re going on a date,” his mother announces, motioning towards the fancy dress she’s wearing. Childe thinks it looks the same as her other dresses, though he doesn’t dare say that out loud. \r\n\r\n“A date? Who?”\r\n\r\n“Your father and I, of course!” his mother says. She pushes him out of the lounge and towards the front door, even though Childe’s only been home for ten seconds. “Mr. Zhongli suggested that we should watch this play at the Heyu Tea House, and your father decided it would be a perfect opportunity for the two of us to have a date. Isn’t that romantic?”\r\n\r\nChilde trips into the hallway. “Uh. Yes…? But why are you pushing me out of the door?”\r\n\r\nTypical. His family has only been here for two days and he’s already being thrown out of his own apartment.\r\n\r\n“Look after the children while we’re gone, Ajax,” his father tells him. “Mr. Zhongli is already with them. I heard he was taking them out of the harbour.”\r\n\r\nChilde blinks. Why is he only hearing about this now? Since when did his family make plans with Zhongli instead of him?\r\n\r\n“What? Where? Huh?”\r\n\r\nLaughing, his mother pats him on the head and literally shoves him out of the apartment. “They only left a few minutes ago. You should be able to catch them before they leave the harbour.”\r\n\r\nWith that, she blows him a kiss and closes the door in his face. \r\n\r\nChilde stands there, shocked beyond belief because Zhongli has somehow convinced his parents to go on a date and he’s now out babysitting Tonia, Teucer, and Anthon. \r\n\r\nHe’s let Lumine take care of Teucer before, so the thought of Zhongli with his siblings shouldn’t invoke fear into his bones. And then he thinks about Teucer playing hide and seek with Zhongli, only to cheat during the game and, in turn, the ex-Archon recognises that as breaking one of his contracts. \r\n\r\nArchons above. Childe sprints off in the direction of the harbour, half convinced Zhongli has already dropped a meteor on his siblings.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOkay, he was overreacting. When Childe finds them, they’re in the fields outside Liyue and no one has yet been flattened by any falling meteors. Anthon is climbing what looks one of Zhongli’s geo pillars and Tonia is staring up at him as if she’s contemplating whether she wants to join in or tell him to come down. Teucer is the first to spot Childe, his face breaking out into a giant grin. \r\n\r\n“Brother! You’re here! Look what Mr. Zhongli can do!” \r\n\r\nChilde looks. The moment his eyes land on Zhongli, he remembers the last time he saw him, he was—as Paimon crudely puts it—slurping up his neck. \r\n\r\nDon’t think about it, please, Childe begs himself as his eyes trail down Zhongli’s face, landing on the spot under his jaw. \r\n\r\nFuck. The hickey is still there. And it’s gotten worse. \r\n\r\n“Hello, Ajax,” Zhongli greets, smiling. \r\n\r\nChilde wants to shake him by the shoulders. Is Zhongli completely unaware that he’s got Teyvat’s largest hickey on his neck? Why didn’t he cover that up? Does he even care?\r\n\r\n“Hi,” Childe all but squeaks out. \r\n\r\nIf Zhongli has spoken to his parents today then there’s no doubt they’ve seen that gigantic hickey. Fuck, half of Liyue Harbour must have already seen it if Zhongli’s walking around without a care in the world. \r\n\r\nChilde can already imagine the bulletin board in Feiyun Slope being updated this very second: ‘Mr. Zhongli, the graceful and knowledgeable consultant of Wangsheng Funeral Parlour, spotted walking around with a large hickey on his neck. Who could his secret lover be?’\r\n\r\nOh, who is Childe kidding? Of course they’re going to think it’s him. Xiangling and her father practically announced it to the whole harbour yesterday. \r\n\r\nGreat. Now the harbour thinks he’s killed Rex Lapis and he’s tried sucking the blood out of Zhongli’s neck. \r\n\r\nEh, whatever. Childe’s never cared about what people thought of him. If everyone in Liyue Harbour thinks he’s suddenly ravishing Zhongli then they can carry on with that. He can think of worse rumours.\r\n\r\n“You… aren’t going to cover that up?” Childe asks, keeping his eyes fixed on his siblings in a desperate attempt to ignore Zhongli’s neck. Tonia has decided to join Anthon in climbing the geo pillars while Teucer cheers them on.\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of his eyes, Childe sees Zhongli tilt his head at him. \r\n\r\n“Your neck,” Childe elaborates. “Surely you must have seen what I, uh, did to you last night.”\r\n\r\nHe winces. He should have worded that better. \r\n\r\n“Oh, this? Master Hu Tao found great amusement in it this morning. She says she applauds you. I fail to understand why something like this is worthy of praise.”\r\n\r\nNow, Childe turns to him, unable to hide the look of horror slowly dawning on his face. \r\n\r\nZhongli blinks, lifting a hand to rub his neck. “It is merely a bruise from when you were—”\r\n\r\n“Okay. That’s… great to know,” Childe speaks over him, faking a laugh that must have sounded more like a sob. \r\n\r\nIs Zhongli really this dense? Is he playing around with Childe? Surely he can’t have been the first person to ever plant a hickey on this guy? \r\n\r\nThen again, considering that Zhongli was a literal god, Childe doubts he was an easy catch—but who could be sure? Zhongli has lived for thousands of years, he must have been with someone before. Maybe Guizhong, or another god, or maybe even some lucky mortal. \r\n\r\nChilde shakes his head to himself. He’s going to stop thinking about this. Debating over Zhongli’s sex life was not part of their contract. \r\n\r\n“Brother, look! I’m so high up! Mr. Zhongli is so cool!” \r\n\r\nBless Anthon for coming in at the right time to distract him. Childe plasters on the largest smile and waves at his younger brother. From atop the geo pillar, Anthon waves back, his glasses almost falling off his face in all his excitement. \r\n\r\n“Even cooler than me?” Childe asks. “You’re going to make me jealous.”\r\n\r\n“A-Ah… This is higher than I expected…” he hears Tonia say once she’s clambered up the other pillar. Her hair has escaped out of its bun; it’s a wonder she can see anything with it flying all over the place.\r\n\r\nTonia pushes her hair away from her eyes. Within seconds, her complexion grow paler as soon as she sees how high up she is. \r\n\r\nHe takes a step closer, holding out his arms. “You alright, Princess? Want me to help you come down?”\r\n\r\nTonia pouts and shakes her head, reminding Childe that stubbornness runs in their family. \r\n\r\n“Sister Tonia! Hurry up and catch it! The glowy thing!” Teucer jumps up and down, pointing at what Childe assumes is the ‘glowy thing’, which is, in fact, a geo crystalfly. “It’s going to fly away!”\r\n\r\nTonia huffs and leans over the edge of the pillar. “I’m trying! AH—”\r\n\r\nChilde’s heart stops when she falls off. He hasn’t even managed to blink before Zhongli is already there, catching Tonia into his arms. \r\n\r\n“Careful,” Zhongli says, helping her back to her feet. Even from where Childe is standing, he can see that Tonia’s face has turned as red as her hair. \r\n\r\nShe stumbles away from Zhongli. “I-I’m sorry!”\r\n\r\nChilde wastes no time sprinting to them. “Are you hurt?” \r\n\r\n“No, I’m fine... I caught this.” \r\n\r\nTonia lifts her palms and shows him a glowing orb nestled in her grasp.  It pulses a golden glow that dwindles weaker and weaker by the second until it completely dies out. In its place is what looks like a lacklustre diamond.\r\n\r\nAnthon jumps down the pillar and barges between Childe and Tonia, waving a diamond of his own. “I have one too! What is it?”\r\n\r\n“A crystalfly, specifically a geo crystalfly. They are beings of pure elemental energy absorbed from the atmosphere,” Zhongli answers them and motions towards the diamond Tonia is holding. “That is their core. The lifespan of a crystalfly is fleeting; once it senses it is in danger, it will dissipate into the air. If caught, their crystal cores are often used as ingredients for alchemy.”\r\n\r\nTo Childe’s great amusement, his siblings all go oooooh in simultaneous chorus. It’s one of Zhongli’s many talents; sharing useless trivia and making it sound interesting for any audience, regardless of their age. \r\n\r\nTeucer pops his head into their little group huddle, squinting at Zhongli. “Mr. Zhongli, can you fight too?”\r\n\r\nAnthon’s eyes light up. “Are you as strong as Big Brother?”\r\n\r\n“No one is as strong as Big Brother!”\r\n\r\nChilde laughs. That’s a good question, actually, and it’s a reminder that Childe has not yet fought Zhongli at all, which he considers a crime considering he has always wanted to test how strong the oldest Archon of Teyvat could be. \r\n\r\nIt won’t be the same now that Zhongli no longer has his gnosis though. Shame. \r\n\r\nGrinning, he turns to the man in question. The expression on Zhongli’s face looks like he already knows what Childe is going to ask him. \r\n\r\n“How about we find out, Zhongli?” Childe asks. “Let’s have spar to entertain the kids?”\r\n\r\nAs expected, the only response Childe receives is a minuscule frown. Zhongli’s amber eyes flicker between him and his siblings, as if weighing the consequences between battling Childe or risking the disappointment of the children should he refuse. \r\n\r\n“Just a quick spar,” Childe promises. “Indulge me a little.”\r\n\r\nTonia claps her hands while Anthon and Teucer jump up and down, inching closer and closer to Zhongli. Funnily enough, Childe notices Zhongli’s shoulders have tensed up. \r\n\r\n“Yes!” the children cheer. \r\n\r\nWithin seconds, Zhongli’s shoulders deflate and he lets out a huff of defeat. \r\n\r\n“A quick spar,” he sternly repeats.\r\n\r\nPleased, Childe tells his siblings to stand back. All three of them scurry behind a fence.\r\n\r\nHe almost wants to laugh at the notion of a quick spar. Quick spar or not, Childe can already feel the familiar bubble of adrenaline that feeds him every day. It’s a flicker of flames touching a valley of grass; he finds it hard to control, and most times he does not. He relishes in the moment when he can strike and let everything go, be the weapon he has trained to be. \r\n\r\nEvery battle, he thinks, is the same; whether it\'s a spar, or a training session, or a duel that almost kills him. It\'s only in these moments that Childe truly feels alive. \r\n\r\nZhongli stands tall at the other side of the field, the tails of his coat rippling in the wind. Today, Liyue has been covered in a swarm of dark, grey clouds, a stark contrast to the blinding heat from this past week. Childe senses a storm is approaching soon. He summons his bow and weighs it in his hands, keeping his gaze fixed on Zhongli.\r\n\r\nEven from this distance, Zhongli\'s eyes are piercing and bright. With a wave of an arm, his spear materialises by his side.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready?” he asks. \r\n\r\nChilde pulls back the bowstring and shoots. Zhongli only has to tilt his head slightly for the arrow to hurtle past his ear. \r\n\r\nChilde grins. “Oh yeah.” \r\n\r\nZhongli lunges forward; a blur of gold and onyx accompanied by the whistle of the wind and the rain of his spears. In the blink of an eye, the ex-Archon is in front of him and Childe parries his attack with his blades. His grin widens and he pushes forward, eyes transfixed on Zhongli and nothing but Zhongli. The ground trembles beneath his feet as Zhongli refuses to budge. Childe’s always known he was strong and the thought of finally, finally witnessing it this second sends euphoria through his veins. \r\n\r\nIn unison, the two of them jump back. Childe is the first to strike again. The drumming of his pulse rises in his ears until it’s all he hears. Childe moves with it, a deafening chorus that only grows louder every time his blades clash with Zhongli’s spear. They match each other like music and choreography; a strike and another parry, a feint to the side and a dodge.\r\n\r\nIt’s impossible to fathom how long this goes for; five seconds, an hour, a lifetime, but the longer it lasts, the more he notices that Zhongli is on the defensive. His expression remains as immovable as stone. He’s calm. He’s holding back. \r\n\r\nHe grits his teeth. No. He wants more. \r\n\r\nChilde retreats, catching the slight hesitation flashing in Zhongli’s face. He slots his blades together, transforming it into a polearm. \r\n\r\n“You’re holding back,” Childe says, twisting the weapon in his hand. It weighs as any polearm would; solidified water rushing forward like a tide in a storm. With this moment of reprieve, Childe feels the tapping of raindrops on his face. Above them, the grey clouds are stirring, groaning, and thunder grumbles in the distance. \r\n\r\nZhongli doesn’t say anything—Childe doesn’t give him a chance to. He launches into the air and plunges down where the ex-Archon is standing. Water erupts around them as Zhongli blocks his attack, still as calm and graceful as ever. Then, a crackle of electricity dances along the droplets in the air, not enough to be seen, but enough to feel it as a prickle on your skin or a caress along your cheek. It’s the only warning Zhongli gets before lightning bursts between them. \r\n\r\nChilde jumps back, reigning his delusion in. Electricity continues to bristle in his veins like a thousand, shuddering needles, and there’s a faint scent of burning skin mixed with the rain-wet earth. He flexes his hands until the pain ebbs away and the rain howls louder. \r\n\r\nHe’d timed it perfectly so his siblings would think that lightning came from the storm, but he knows Zhongli is not so easily fooled. Zhongli rises from where he’d thrown himself back. He stands tall once again, but long gone is the firm serenity that refused to leave his face. His eyes narrow at Childe, jaws clenched. The tails of his coat are singed, his shirt soaked and clinging to him like a second skin, the golden tips of his hair glowing against the dark sky. \r\n\r\nFor a second, the sight leaves Childe breathless. \r\n\r\nThe sound of the storm amplifies in his head. All he hears is thunder drumming in his pulse, louder, louder. Beneath him, the ground groans, shakes, and it takes him a second too long to realise this is not because of the storm. Pillars erupt from where he’s standing, throwing him back. He lands in a river and vaguely registers the ache spreading down his spine. \r\n\r\nIn the corner of his eyes, he notices that the ex-Archon is nowhere to be seen—\r\n\r\nHe dives back as Zhongli descends on him. There’s a burst of water and debris, of lightning and rain. River water soaks into his clothes and Zhongli is on top of him, thighs pressed on either side of Childe’s waist, and his spear lodged into the ground next to his head. Strands of Zhongli’s hair tickle Childe’s cheeks; he’s so close Childe can see the rouge drawn under his eyes is now smudged from the rain. So close he can feel the warmth of his body pressed against him. \r\n\r\nChilde hisses a breath in. His hands move without him thinking about it. He grips Zhongli\'s thighs. Then, he thrusts his hips up—and there’s a maddening second where it feels good, too good, and he sees Zhongli’s eyes widen, hears him gasp, and Childe almost does it again, again—\r\n\r\nZhongli pushes himself off him, ripping his spear off the ground. \r\n\r\n“That\'s enough,” he grits out. \r\n\r\nThe stern edge in his voice snaps Childe out of it like a bucket of cold water. He blinks back into reality and struggles to catch up with the rampaging of his thoughts. Zhongli turns his back on him and summons his spear away.\r\n\r\nShit, Childe thinks. Shit. That wasn’t supposed to happen. That shouldn’t have happened—\r\n\r\n“That was so cool!”\r\n\r\nTeucer jumps into view with the largest grin Childe has ever seen on him. And really, nothing yanks you away from your raging hormone-induced thoughts more than a younger sibling staring at you like you’re the world’s greatest hero. \r\n\r\nChilde finally has enough strength to stand back up, but the world spins faster than a rolling geovishap and Childe thinks he might be sick. Or that might be all these strange emotions threatening to bubble out of his throat. He rubs his head, trying his best to ignore them. \r\n\r\n“Who won?” Anthon asks, shaking Childe’s elbow. “Did you win, Brother?”\r\n\r\nChilde swallows the dry lump in his throat. “It was a draw.”\r\n\r\nWhen he looks at Zhongli again, he doesn’t know whether to be relieved or worried that the ex-Archon still has his back turned to them. \r\n\r\nTeucer wails. “Aaw, that’s no fun!”\r\n\r\n“You know what else isn’t fun?” Childe ruffles Teucer’s hair and tickles his sides, chuckling when his brother screams louder than the storm itself. “Thunderstorms. Come on, it’s pouring it down now. Let’s get back home before we all get sick.”\r\n\r\nChilde needs a bath, he decides as his brain fills his thoughts with images of Zhongli gasping above him. A very, very cold bath. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow that he’s finished freezing all of the inappropriate thoughts out of his system, Childe leaves the bathroom and yawns into his hand. He’s surprised to find that his apartment is eerily silent. It’s late in the evening but his siblings are usually far too stubborn to sleep this early. \r\n\r\nHe peeks into their room and finds a miracle. \r\n\r\n“Wow, you got them to fall asleep.” Childe whistles, leaning on the doorframe. “That takes talent, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\nZhongli sits on the edge of the bed, smoothing down the blanket over the slumbering forms of Childe’s siblings. It really is a miracle; Tonia, Teucer, and Anthon are all huddled together and snoring in unison. Childe’s bath didn’t even last that long; probably over half an hour. Usually, it takes him at least an hour of stories for his siblings to finally fall asleep.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing his voice, Zhongli looks up. “They asked me to tell them a story.”\r\n\r\nChilde chuckles, thinking back to all of Zhongli’s stories. His voice is always calm and soothing; it’s no wonder the kids fell asleep so quickly.\r\n\r\n“Did you tell them about the amazing Rex Lapis?”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s eyes crinkle with amusement. “Those are the stories I know best.”\r\n\r\n“You should tell me some of them one day,” Childe says. “I’ve always wanted to get to know him better.”\r\n\r\nThe smile that Zhongli gives him is almost radiant. He stands, passing through Childe, so close he catches the scent of incense and sandalwood. \r\n\r\n“I will take you up on that invitation one day then,” Zhongli says. \r\n\r\nWatching the gentle sway of his hair, Childe follows him into the lounge. They haven’t spoken about the spar at all. If it weren’t for the singed ends of Zhongli’s coat, Childe would think it was all a figment of his imagination. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which… He’ll have to get Zhongli a new coat. Surely there’s a tailor here in Liyue who can replicate it.\r\n\r\n“About earlier…” Childe rubs the back of his neck, his voice trailing off as Zhongli looks over his shoulder to stare at him. “I’m sorry if I went too far. Actually, I should apologise for last night too.”\r\n\r\nZhongli turns to him and folds his arms. There’s no sign of any anger on his face, although it’s not like Childe expected that. In all the time he’s known Zhongli, he doesn’t think he’s ever seen the consultant lose his temper. He’s not sure if such a thing is even possible. \r\n\r\n“It is all part of our contract,” Zhongli says. “There is no need to apologise.”\r\n\r\nChilde looks away, resisting the urge to frown. Right. That’s correct. He should be relieved that Zhongli is unfazed with everything that’s happened so far. Should be. \r\n\r\nInstead, Childe can’t ignore the ugly weight clawing at the edges of his chest. He slowly takes a deep breath and forces a smile on his face, nodding at Zhongli. \r\n\r\n“Yeah, I know,” he says. “Just making sure.”\r\n\r\nOutside, a strong gust rattles the wooden boards of the window. The storm doesn’t look like it’s calming down any time soon. \r\n\r\n“I hope Mother and Father are okay…” Childe mumbles. His parents picked the worst day to go out for their sudden date. Can you even still watch plays when the weather is this bad? \r\n\r\nJust then, Childe hears the sound of the front door bursting open. He rushes to the hallway, greeted by the sight of his parents soaked head to toe. Within seconds, there’s a huge puddle in the corridor.\r\n\r\n“Mother! Father!” Childe calls. For a second, he’s worried—then his mother starts cackling with laughter and he can only stare at her in confusion. “What’s so funny?”\r\n\r\nShe throws her head back and laughs even louder. Childe glances at Zhongli, who has taken the liberty to carry the huge collection of bags his parents have brought home with them. Childe’s eyes widen. He gave them some Mora to go shopping with, but did they buy everything in Liyue? \r\n\r\nOnce Childe’s mother has calmed down, she takes her coat off and hands it to him. \r\n\r\n“Your father suggested we run back here before the storm gets worse, but how am I supposed to run with these shoes?” She lifts her leg up to show him the tallest pair of heels he’s ever seen in his life. He could probably stab someone with those. “So, he decided to carry me and sprint back here!”\r\n\r\nChilde looks at his dad, and then towards the dozen bags Zhongli is now carrying. \r\n\r\nHis father laughs, holding his back. “I overestimated myself. Seems like my body’s not as fit as it used to be.”\r\n\r\nChilde is pretty certain anyone would struggle to carry a grown woman and a dozen shopping bags at the same time, all the while running through a storm. \r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t be laughing at this,” his mother says, still laughing. “I think he’s pulled a muscle.”\r\n\r\nChilde shakes his head and lets out a chuckle of his own. “Please sit down. I’ll get the fireplace ready. And what is all this?” He gestures to the bags Zhongli is holding. “Did you two buy half of Liyue’s market stock?”\r\n\r\n“They’re all presents for Tonia’s birthday, of course,” his father says. “Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” he quickly answers. \r\n\r\nChilde knew it was her birthday soon. Before the fake relationship, he’d been planning on sending a large crate full of toys and clothes for her. Ever since his family arrived in Liyue, he’d been too caught up in the whole mess to realise how fast her birthday was approaching. \r\n\r\nIt shouldn’t be any problem. With Tonia here, he can give her a better present than a crate full of toys and clothes. \r\n\r\nAll of them settle by the fireplace once Childe’s parents are dried and the gifts they bought for Tonia are safely hidden away from her curious eyes. Childe sits next to Zhongli, muttering a soft thanks when the consultant offers him a cup of tea. \r\n\r\nThen, he throws caution to the wind and leans against Zhongli, laying his head on his shoulder. Childe feels him stiffen for the shortest of seconds, enough for him to think this was a bad idea, oh shit—\r\n\r\nZhongli wraps an arm around his shoulder and pulls him closer, launching his pulse to unhealthy heights. \r\n\r\nAs expected, his parents are staring at them like they’ve just seen an oasis in a desert. Childe takes a sip from his cup and hopes it hides the blush spreading through his face. Please.\r\n\r\nBy some sort of miracle, his mother chooses mercy and doesn’t comment on it. Instead, she faces Zhongli and beams at him. “Mr. Zhongli, we watched one of Ms. Yun’s plays as you suggested. She’s very good.”\r\n\r\nZhongli nods. Every movement he makes sends the scent of sandalwood and incense spinning in Childe’s head. He breathes it in, feeling dizzy. \r\n\r\n“Yes, she is one of the best performers here in Liyue. Watching her plays during the evening has become a regular occurrence for me.”\r\n\r\n“I watched her once with you, didn’t I?” Childe looks up at him. Big mistake because the first thing he lays eyes on are Zhongli’s lips. Which are dangerously close. \r\n\r\nZhongli meets his gaze. Childe swears he feels his arm tighten around him. “Yes, you did. You said the play needed more fighting in it and I had to stop you from joining the stage.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yeah, I remember now.” He smirks. “Well, it did need a bit more action.”\r\n\r\n“It was a romantic play.”\r\n\r\n“Romance can have some action too…” Childe shrugs, fixing his eyes on his cup of tea instead. If Zhongli keeps looking at him like that, he doesn’t think his heart is going to survive. \r\n\r\nAnother gust of wind sends the windows rattling. Childe looks outside and sees nothing but pitch black skies. “That storm doesn’t look like it’s going to end any time soon.”\r\n\r\nZhongli sits up. To Childe’s disappointment, he unwinds his arm around him. \r\n\r\n“I ought to return to the parlour.”\r\n\r\n“In this weather? Nonsense!” Childe’s father says.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he’s right,” his mother agrees, nodding enthusiastically. “You are welcome to stay over for the night, Mr. Zhongli.”\r\n\r\nChilde blinks. “He is?”\r\n\r\nIn less than a second, his mother throws him a disapproving look that sends Childe back to his days as a kid.\r\n\r\n“Ajax, are you going to allow Mr. Zhongli to walk out in that storm? He might get sick!”\r\n\r\nZhongli slowly shakes his head. “The funeral parlour is not too far away, and I rarely get sick…”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no, dear. I’m sure Ajax wouldn’t mind it if you stayed over. What kind of fiancé—”\r\n\r\nChilde sighs. “Mother, I’ve told you many times we’re not—”\r\n\r\n“—would Ajax be if he let you leave in this weather?”\r\n\r\nAll eyes turn to him. It takes all of his mental strength not to let out a defeated groan. Ruthless. His parents are truly ruthless. \r\n\r\nChilde turns to Zhongli, smiling as wide as he can. “Mother’s right. You simply must stay, Zhongli.”\r\n\r\nHe sinks back into the couch and drinks the rest of his tea, trying his best to ignore the triumphant look on his mother’s face. \r\n\r\nHis father laughs. “You can finally put that large bed of yours to good use, Ajax.”\r\n\r\nChilde promptly spits out his tea. “Father!”\r\n\r\n“Gavriil, you’ve made him as red as a tomato!” His mother cackles so loud he’s sure Tonia, Teucer, and Anthon are probably awake by now. \r\n\r\nRuthless! Beyond ruthless! Childe grabs Zhongli’s wrist and drags him out of the lounge. By the time they’re in his bedroom, he can still hear his parents laughing at the top of their lungs. At this point, Childe begs the ground to swallow him whole and take him back to the Abyss. He’ll take on fighting monstrous beasts from another world if it meant his parents wouldn’t ever make jokes like that again.\r\n\r\nChilde bangs his head against the door. “Archons, my parents are determined to make this more difficult than it has to be.”\r\n\r\n“If it makes you uncomfortable, I can insist on leaving.”\r\n\r\nHe turns to Zhongli, realising he’s still holding his wrist. Childe quickly lets go and steps back. “No, no. It’s not that… I just… Eh, it doesn’t matter. Are you okay with staying?”\r\n\r\nChilde watches as Zhongli scans his room, as if taking it in. There isn’t much to see in the first place; Childe isn’t the type to fill his surroundings with sentimental items. As such, his room is barren, save for the stack of paperwork strewn all over his desk… which reminds him that he has a few letters he hasn’t replied to yet. \r\n\r\n“If your parents insist I should stay, then they will become suspicious if we are strongly against that idea,” Zhongli says.\r\n\r\nRight. Of course. Childe can only nod at that. Not knowing what else to say, he walks over to his desk and sifts through the letters in search of any he’d need to quickly respond to. Scaramouche… He’ll… save that for another day. Or another week. That midget’s off to Inazuma by now anyway; what could he possibly want from Childe? There’s a few letters from La Signora too, but Childe skims through the contents and decides they’re not worth a response. At least one of the letters is just her insulting him for three paragraphs. Hmm. Maybe he’ll write back with a similar letter of his own when he’s feeling particularly petty.\r\n\r\nOh, and one letter from Pulcinella. He quickly reads through that, grimacing as he reaches the end. It was inevitable, but the Harbingers have heard about the news of his family staying in Liyue. While Pulcinella’s letter remains formal, Childe does not miss the hidden warning underneath his polite words. He’s allowed to keep his family here as long he doesn’t let it distract him from his duties as a Harbinger. \r\n\r\nChilde sighs. No distractions. As if the biggest distraction in his entire life isn’t currently in his room right this very second. \r\n\r\n“Is something the matter?”\r\n\r\nSpeak of the devil… \r\n\r\nChilde turns around and sees that Zhongli is sitting at the edge of his bed, an other-worldly presence that looks out of place in this room. \r\n\r\n“Everything’s fine,” Childe says. “I’ll get you some clothes you can change into. We’re about the same size…”\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, Childe deeply regrets this. How is it possible for one man to look that good? He’s so used to seeing Zhongli wearing several layers of clothes that it doesn’t feel right to see him only wearing a silk shirt and pants. \r\n\r\nChilde tries, and fails, to stop staring. Zhongli has set his hair loose and rubbed the makeup off his eyes, and yet he still manages to look like a famous model. The shirt is a bit loose on him, allowing Childe a glimpse of his collarbones… Shit, this is the most skin he’s ever seen on Zhongli. He can even see his ankles. Is this allowed? Childe swears this is bordering on sacrilege.\r\n\r\n“May I wear this?” Zhongli asks, completely unaware of the downfall of Childe’s sanity. He lifts a silken black robe, waving it slightly. \r\n\r\nChilde nods, unable to formulate anything coherent.\r\n\r\nZhongli slips the robe on and smooths down its nonexistent creases. The combination of the black robe along with the crimson pajamas is a good look on him. \r\n\r\n“You look…” Childe swallows down the dry lump in his throat. Zhongli stares at him, waiting. “Comfortable.”\r\n\r\nVery smooth, his asshole of a brain praises him. Ignoring it, Childe quickly grabs a pillow and a blanket for himself, eager to sleep these thoughts away. If he can sleep at all, that is. \r\n\r\n“You can take the bed, by the way,” he says. “I’ll sleep on the floor.”\r\n\r\n“That is unnecessary. There is enough room for the both of us here.”\r\n\r\nChilde squints at Zhongli, who is once again sitting at the edge of the bed. He frowns back at him, golden eyes almost glowing in the near darkness. \r\n\r\n“I know, but…”\r\n\r\nZhongli reaches for the pillow in his arms, slowly prying it from his grasp. “Your parents will grow suspicious if they find you sleeping on the floor rather than with me.”\r\n\r\n“I should hope they value my privacy enough to not barge into my bedroom…” Childe mutters. He spares one last glance at the floor and groans. “But you’re right.”\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a long night. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Your parents are interesting.”\r\n\r\nHalf an hour of staring at the ceiling and failing to sleep had been painfully awkward, to say the least. Childe is almost glad to hear Zhongli’s voice breaking the silence. He turns to his side, searching for Zhongli’s face in the darkness. He sees it as a faint outline against the amber glow of the candles, too dark to fathom his expression but enough to know that those golden eyes are piercing into him. \r\n\r\nChilde whispers into the dark: “What do you mean by that?”\r\n\r\nHe does not get an answer straight away. Waiting, he watches the faint glow of the candles dance along Zhongli’s jaw. This bed is large enough to fit both of them, yet with Zhongli here it feels as if Childe is close to suffocating. When he breathes, all he smells is sandalwood and incense, the fresh scent of earth after rain. Zhongli. \r\n\r\nHe breathes again; in, out, in, out, until his eyes adjust to the darkness and he can see Zhongli is watching him. \r\n\r\n“I am still struggling to understand the complexities of human emotion,” Zhongli says after a while. “I know of happiness and anger, loss… Those are emotions that humans often show freely and you are able to recognise it from their faces. But there are some emotions that are not as obvious.”\r\n\r\nChilde gulps. “Like what?”\r\n\r\n“Love.”\r\n\r\n“...Huh.”\r\n\r\nHe hears Zhongli sigh, stirring the blanket over them so it brushes Childe’s leg. \r\n\r\n“Over the years, I have learnt that humans use love to convey their appreciation for many things, be it money, food, or friendship, but when it comes to romantic love… It seems that is a much deeper level, something which is quite revered in stories or plays. I used to wonder what made it so special.”\r\n\r\nChilde remains silent. He’s not sure how to respond, or why exactly Zhongli is bringing this up. \r\n\r\nAs if sensing his uncertainty, Zhongli speaks on. “Even with my limited understanding of it, I can see that your parents are very much in love. Their happiness radiates the room.”\r\n\r\nChilde lets out a quiet laugh. “Yeah… They\'ve always been like that. I think that\'s why my mother is so obsessed with the idea of us getting married. She probably wants the same for me.”\r\n\r\nHe thinks he sees Zhongli’s eyebrows furrow. It’s hard to tell in the shadows. “You don’t sound enthusiastic about that. Does the idea of marriage not appeal to you?”\r\n\r\nChilde shrugs. “Never cared for it. It\'s as you say: I never knew what made it so special either. It doesn’t feel like a life that could belong to me.”\r\n\r\n“Have you never felt love before?”\r\n\r\n“I love my family, but as for romantic love…” Childe pauses. “I don\'t think so.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm.”\r\n\r\n“...Have you?” Childe asks, remembering what Venti had said. Guizhong. If Zhongli has ever loved anyone, then surely it would be her?\r\n\r\nZhongli moves once again, and this time, Childe feels their legs bump into each other. He almost shifts away, in case Zhongli would prefer some space, but he stops himself. He’s not sure if he wants to move away. Or if he can. \r\n\r\nSo, he stays in place and hopes Zhongli can’t hear how loud his heart is hammering against his ribs. \r\n\r\n“I… don\'t even know what it is exactly meant to feel like,” Zhongli says, his voice so low it sends pinpricks up Childe’s arms. “I am aware that it’s supposed to make you feel happiness… But I also know it makes you feel desire.”\r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t realise he’s let out of a breath of relief until it escapes him. He’d been certain that Guizhong was… \r\n\r\nNo. Why does that even matter? Why is he thinking about such things? \r\n\r\nHe shoves that topic aside and thinks back on Zhongli’s words. \r\n\r\n“Desire and love aren\'t always synonymous, you know,” he says. “You can feel a desire for someone you barely know. Sometimes, it can just be… a reaction.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“You said that love can make you feel desire, and that\'s true… But you can still want someone without understanding any of what you\'re feeling.”\r\n\r\nChilde does not know why he’s saying this all of a sudden. He’s never felt romantically attracted to anyone before, not even close. He has slept with people in the past, but it never led to anything more and nor did he want it to. Even then, he barely counts those as anything close to desire. Distraction, maybe. A result of boredom. \r\n\r\nHe finds Zhongli’s eyes in the darkness. “Have you ever felt that? Desire?”\r\n\r\nChilde’s treading on dangerous ground here. The only sensible part of his brain is telling him to stop this conversation before he ends up regretting it. Unfortunately, the rest of him isn’t listening to that voice. Instead, he waits for Zhongli’s answer with bated breath. \r\n\r\n“I… feel things, but it is difficult to understand what they are. I only know that I feel emotions which are positive, or negative, but labelling them is difficult,” Zhongli lets out what sounds like a quiet sigh. “I have dedicated all of my existence to contracts, but emotions cannot be held by such.”\r\n\r\nChilde can’t help but smile at this. He doesn’t think he’s ever heard Zhongli sounds so uncertain before.  \r\n\r\n“Even humans have a hard time putting a label on their own emotions, xiansheng. It\'s as you say: we know if it makes us feel good or not, but we don\'t always know what the feeling is, or why we\'re feeling that.” He reaches over to pat Zhongli on his arm. “Sounds pretty human to me.”\r\n\r\nZhongli hums. “Then I suppose I am adjusting to mortal life better than I imagined.”\r\n\r\nThey fall into silence. The sound of rain has long stopped and night is peaceful once more. It’s quiet, too quiet. Empty. Childe turns to lay on his back, staring up at the ceiling. He has a feeling he’ll be staring at this all night. \r\n\r\n“What is… desire supposed to feel like?”\r\n\r\nChilde freezes. Now this conversation really is diving into dangerous territory. He keeps his gaze pinned on the ceiling despite knowing that Zhongli is staring at him, waiting. \r\n\r\n“It… makes you want more,” he chokes out. “You feel like you can’t control yourself and you don’t understand why you feel like this, but… you just want that person.”\r\n\r\n“...I see.”\r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t dare look at Zhongli, and nor does he dare entertain the idea of asking if Zhongli has ever felt like that. \r\n\r\nHe also avoids thinking about the fact that maybe, just maybe, that description he gave hits a bit closer to home than he’d like it to. \r\n\r\n“We should get some sleep,” Childe quickly says. He turns to the other side, making sure his back is facing Zhongli, and scowls into the darkness. Sleep feels like an impossible task tonight. \r\n\r\n“Yes,” he hears Zhongli saying. “Goodnight, Childe.”\r\n\r\n“Goodnight, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter what feels like two hours of staring into the darkness, Childe concludes there is no way he is getting any sleep tonight. Making sure not to wake Zhongli up, he shuffles out of the blankets and fumbles around for his slippers. \r\n\r\nZhongli remains fast asleep. Childe can’t resist staring at him before he goes. Candlelight paints the edges of his figure and basks him in an amber glow, mixing with the onyx ripples of his silken robe. His chest rises and falls with each breath, long hair fanning around the blanket like dark strokes of paint on canvas. \r\n\r\nChilde leans across the bed and gently moves a strand of Zhongli’s hair away from his face. As if sensing him, the ex-Archon leans closer and sighs. \r\n\r\nHe holds his breath, not daring to risk any sound. His gaze moves down to Zhongli’s parted lips. \r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\nHe clenches his jaw and rips his hand away. Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, he chants in his head as he forces some distance between them. Without sparing another look at Zhongli, he crosses the other side of the room. \r\n\r\nChilde needs to breathe. He throws open the window and climbs out, bracing himself against the sudden gust of wind that greets him. The storm is no more; the only remnant left of it is the cold breeze that bites into his skin and the scent of petrichor amidst the air. \r\n\r\nWith his apartment situated in one of the top floors of the guesthouse, his bedroom window leads to a set of rooftops that overlook the front harbour. It’s become a habit for Childe to climb out of his window and admire the view of the city from above.\r\n\r\nLiyue is a beautiful city, but it is even more breathtaking past sunset. From this distance, every lantern glows like an amber beacon in the vermilion streets. Even late at night, Liyue is alive with business; there are people cheering in the bars, stories being told in the tea houses, orders being shouted from across the pier where its men work late into the night. \r\n\r\nChilde sits at the edge of the rooftop and listens. He’s been in Liyue for so long that he can tell who is shouting from the harbour. Amidst the noise, he also spots the lone figure of a Fatui guard watching the sea from the front of the harbour. Vlad, he thinks his name is, and he only knows this because Childe remembers this particular guard had been asking to be sent back to Snezhnaya—\r\n\r\nThe sound of footsteps yank him away from his thoughts. He looks up as Zhongli sits next to him.\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” Childe says. “Did I wake you?”\r\n\r\nZhongli shakes his head. “The view here is lovely.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. I like sitting out here at night and just watching the city.”\r\n\r\nZhongli tilts his head at him. “Are you not tired?”\r\n\r\nYes, Childe wants to say. But I can’t sleep because you’re there.\r\n\r\n“Nope, not really,” he lies. \r\n\r\nHe gazes up at the sky and wonders when the sun will rise. With Zhongli next to him, it feels like tonight is never-ending. \r\n\r\nWhat’s wrong with him? He’s always spent time with Zhongli, but he has never felt this restless before. Now, it feels like all of his senses are attuned to the god, sending his thoughts running round and round in circles. \r\n\r\nHe doesn’t want to think. Whenever he thinks, it ends up leading him to a spiral of doubts and emotions he can\'t understand. Or he doesn\'t want to understand. \r\n\r\nFrustrated, Childe stands up. \r\n\r\n“Xiansheng… Fight me again. Now.”\r\n\r\nZhongli blinks up at him, clearly taken aback. “Now?”\r\n\r\n“Because of the kids, we were holding ourselves back earlier, so let’s have a rematch.”\r\n\r\n“This is hardly the right time and place.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! A fight can happen anywhere!”\r\n\r\nNarrowing his eyes, Zhongli looks down at the harbour. “People will see us. It will be disruptive if we use our visions this late at night.”\r\n\r\nHe has a point, but Childe has never been one to let something like that stop him from a fight. He quickly climbs back into his bedroom and returns with a pair of wooden spears. \r\n\r\n“Here,” he says, throwing one of them to Zhongli. “Then no visions. We fight with just weapons; the good old fashioned way.”\r\n\r\nZhongli stands, spinning the spear in his hand. “What is this sudden fixation with wishing to fight me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, xiansheng, you know nothing gets my blood pumping more than a good fight, and what better opponent to have than an ex-god?” Childe grins, leading Zhongli to another set of rooftops. Here, there is more space for them to freely move. Obviously, it is not as spacious as an open field, but it will do. \r\n\r\nHe stands on one end of the roof while Zhongli is on the other. From there, the full moon floats behind the ex-Archon, submerging him in silver. \r\n\r\n“This will be the last spar,” Zhongli says, his words final. “Do not ask me again.”\r\n\r\nChilde grips his weapon. “Guess we’ll have to make it a good one then.”\r\n\r\nHe lunges, and the clash of spears sends his pulse kicking once again. In an instant, they meet each parry, each strike, each sweep, synchronised in perfect chorus. The howling of the wind joins them, brushing across Childe’s hair and bare arms as the two weave past each other.\r\n\r\nIt becomes a dance of sorts; Childe stabs forward and Zhongli side-steps away, his movements lithe, graceful. Before he can blink, the tip of a spear hurtles into his vision and Childe throws himself back, dodging in time. He smirks, regaining his balance while Zhongli summons his weapon back to his side. \r\n\r\nThey leap into each other, clashing in mid-air. As they fall back into their flurry of blows, Childe feints to the side, watching as Zhongli follows his movement. When he sees the ex-Archon move, he sweeps his spear downwards, intent on catching the other’s legs. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, Zhongli is smart; he should have known that. He dodges, hardly fazed, and sends a kick driving straight into Childe’s chest. It’s so unexpected, so sudden, that Childe staggers, the air in his lungs knocked back. Zhongli descends on him with a whirlwind of jabs, each one faster than the last. \r\n\r\nChilde dodges, or he tries to. As he struggles to regain momentum of the battle, he catches sight of Zhongli encased by the backdrop of moonlight, and it’s as if everything slows to a stop. \r\n\r\nZhongli twists his spear and strikes the blunt end into his gut. Time moves once again and Childe falls into a heap on the rooftop. \r\n\r\nPain spreads through every limb in his body, burning in the core of his stomach where Zhongli had struck him. His head aches, the world is spinning, and the acknowledgement of defeat is heavy in his heart. \r\n\r\nZhongli stands before him, his obsidian robes billowing against the large moon that seems to swallow him whole. His eyes are as bright and gold as the lanterns around Liyue and Childe stares back, transfixed. He doesn’t dare move, not even when Zhongli points the tip of his spear to his neck. \r\n\r\nHe trails it up his throat, so close that Childe feels the blunt blade tickle against his skin. He gulps. \r\n\r\nZhongli keeps his eyes on him as he nudges Childe’s chin up.\r\n\r\n“Do you yield?” he asks. \r\n\r\nChilde’s heart is beating so hard he thinks he\'s going to be sick. His chest is heaving with exhaustion, excitement, adrenaline, and the unmistakable feeling that he wants more, needs more. He wants to take his spear and fight on, he wants to grab Zhongli and push him into the ground, he wants to bury his face into his neck and taste him again, he wants to devour him—\r\n\r\nAnd he’s hard. Very hard. \r\n\r\nWith that startling realisation, he says the only thing he can think of:\r\n\r\n“Shit.”', 'set_in_stone.jpg', '2021-04-25 22:01:32.999941', '2021-04-26 10:15:29.467130', '0', '1', 'set_in_stone_03', '1', '2', 'Set in Stone');
INSERT INTO `sueed_article` VALUES ('4', 'Set in Stone 04', 'the same with 01', 'Chapter 4: New Arrangements\r\n\r\nThere was no denying it. Childe is sporting a full on boner after being beaten up by Zhongli, which, by the way, he’d be more gutted about if he could actually focus on his defeat. \r\n\r\nAlas, he cannot. Instead, he’s about to have a mid-life crisis on top of this roof. There is no way he can deny his attraction for Zhongli now, not when there’s physical proof of it in the form of his stupid dick currently defying gravity. \r\n\r\nShit. \r\n\r\nChilde groans and forces himself to sit up, not so subtly throwing an arm over his crotch in a futile attempt to hide it. \r\n\r\n“Okay, okay, you win for tonight,” he chokes out, unable to look at Zhongli in the eyes. \r\n\r\nSo what if he’s hard? He’s always lived for battles and gotten high off the adrenaline. Granted, he’s never actually gotten hard from a battle before, but there’s a first time for everyone… \r\n\r\nThe fact that it’s Zhongli does not help either. He’s gone and gotten himself attracted to the damn ex-Archon. \r\n\r\nBut that’s it… It’s only an attraction. That’s fine. Childe can deal with that. Zhongli is very attractive; he’d be surprised if he wasn’t the least bit drawn to him. It shouldn’t be any surprise that being around the consultant so much has led to Childe perhaps wanting to sleep with him. \r\n\r\nFuck. \r\n\r\nGet it together, the rational part of his brain speaks up. Why is this such a big deal? There’s nothing wrong with wanting to have sex with someone, and it’s not like there’s anything going on with you and Zhongli…\r\n\r\nRight. This is just a physical attraction. Nothing more. \r\n\r\nDon’t even go there. Remember the contract.\r\n\r\nUgh. How could he forget? Even if he wanted to, there’s no way Zhongli would ever… No. No, he’s not even going to go there. He can’t entertain that idea. \r\n\r\nChilde sighs, finally mustering the courage to turn to the man in question. Zhongli remains where he’s standing, still holding his spear, although he’s no longer pointing it at Childe’s throat. \r\n\r\nGods, Childe hopes Zhongli hasn’t noticed his boner. \r\n\r\nZhongli steps back, tilting his head slightly. “You seem to be physically aroused.”\r\n\r\nNever mind. \r\n\r\nChilde jolts as if he’s been physically struck. He quickly looks away, scouring through his head for any excuse that could explain why his dick is still hard this very moment. \r\n\r\nHe comes up with nothing. The only thought going through his head right now is: shit shit shit shit shit shit.\r\n\r\n“I-I…” Fuck. Sighing, Childe runs a hand through his hair and shakes his head. There’s no point in lying to someone like Zhongli. “Don’t think too much of it, xiansheng. Let’s just go to sleep—”\r\n\r\n“Would you like help in relieving it?”\r\n\r\nChilde blinks. He looks up and blinks again, several times, while watching Zhongli’s impassive face. Then, his words sink in. \r\n\r\n“What?” Childe says. “What?”\r\n\r\nIn true Zhongli fashion, his expression doesn’t change at all. He only nods at Childe. “Is that not what is typically done in this situation? If one is aroused, they will pleasure themselves to—”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, yeah, I know, but why are you offering to help?”\r\n\r\nThat seems to break some emotion onto Zhongli’s face. For a second, his brows furrow into the tiniest frown before it disappears. “This is still within our contract.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Our contract states that there are to be no feelings or complications within this fake relationship, and as you stated earlier, experiencing desire does not necessarily involve feelings as well. Therefore, if we continue with that, then it will still work alongside our contract.”\r\n\r\n...What?\r\n\r\nChilde is so lost that he’s pretty sure his boner has already died. He replays what Zhongli said in his head, going through each word as slowly as he can. As expected of Zhongli, he’s discussing something like this so casually as if they’re talking about the weather. Childe shouldn’t be surprised at all, but… \r\n\r\nHe sits up and scratches his head. “Are you… Are you suggesting that we become friends with benefits?”\r\n\r\n“I’m... not familiar with that term.”\r\n\r\nChilde sighs  again. Why are they even having this conversation? How did they end up talking about this and why why why is Zhongli suggesting it of all things? \r\n\r\nTsaritsa… No, this is definitely something Childe didn’t need to start thinking about. \r\n\r\n“No… That’s… This… No. We shouldn’t. I’m not even sure if you know what you’re suggesting, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\nZhongli narrows his eyes slightly. “I’m suggesting that we enter a sexual arrangement in order to relieve mutual desires, under the pretense that we do not let emotions break our contract. You were the one who proposed that desire does not often lead to—”\r\n\r\n“I know what I said! But why are you okay with that?” Childe interrupts, surprised by the sudden volume of his own voice. He takes a deep breath and swears under his breath. Shit. \r\n\r\nHe’s not the only one who’s shocked. Zhongli stares at him with wide eyes. “I… Have I said something to upset you?”\r\n\r\nChilde automatically shakes his head, pushing himself up to his feet and staring out towards the view of Liyue’s harbour underneath them. He can feel Zhongli’s eyes on him, waiting for a verbal response. \r\n\r\nFuck, he thinks. He is upset. For some reason, having to listen to Zhongli casually talk about something like this as if it barely matters isn’t sitting well with him. \r\n\r\nBut does it really matter? It’s not like Childe hasn’t had casual sex before. He’s not beyond the idea of sleeping with someone and disregarding it the next day.\r\n\r\nFuck, he thinks again. There’s only one reason why this bothers him, and he doesn’t want to dwell on it. He can’t. \r\n\r\n“No, no. I don’t even know why I’m…” He groans and shakes his head again, still unable to look at Zhongli. “Ugh, it doesn’t matter. Let’s just forget about this, okay?”\r\n\r\n“…If that is what you wish.”\r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t wait for Zhongli to follow him. He climbs back into his room and throws himself into bed, desperately hoping he can sleep this off and forget all about it in the morning. \r\n\r\nObviously that’s impossible, and to no one’s surprise, Childe’s traitorous brain is conjuring images of Zhongli offering to relieve him instead. At this point, Childe will gladly bash his head against a wall if it’s going to knock him out and put an end to this night. \r\n\r\nHe hears Zhongli stir next to him. \r\n\r\n“I am sorry for assuming that…” \r\n\r\nChilde turns to face the consultant. He’s so close that their knees bump and the scent of flowers and incense suffocates Childe. He’s going to be smelling Zhongli on his pillows for the rest of the week, he thinks. \r\n\r\n“Xiansheng, it’s fine,” Childe reassures. “You don’t even need to apologise for anything.”\r\n\r\n“I have clearly made you upset.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not upset.” Much.\r\n\r\nChilde pauses. He studies Zhongli’s face for a bit, debating on whether he should say what’s currently on his mind. In the end, he takes the risk and lowers his voice to a whisper.  \r\n\r\n“I’d be lying if the proposition didn’t intrigue me.”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s eyebrows raise ever so slightly. “Oh.”\r\n\r\nThere’s an excruciating second where both of them glance down at each other’s lips at the same time. Childe almost leans in then—no, in fact, he does. His head tilts down and he holds his breath, picturing the moment when he finally closes the distance between them and pushes Zhongli against the sheets. \r\n\r\nHe could. He wants to. He could accept Zhongli’s earlier proposition and see where that leads. The choice is within his grasp and all he has to do is lean in and kiss Zhongli. They can pretend that none of this happened once the sun rises tomorrow. \r\n\r\nHe… \r\n\r\nChilde swallows the lump stuck in his throat. That’s the problem though. He can’t. If anything happened between him and Zhongli, Childe won’t be able to forget about it. \r\n\r\nHe winces. He pushes himself back until he has space to breathe.\r\n\r\n“But it’s best if we don’t go there,” Childe says. “We should get some sleep.”\r\n\r\nSlowly, Zhongli nods. “Goodnight, Childe.”\r\n\r\nChilde turns to the other side and squeezes his eyes shut, blocking out the voice in his head telling him to go back to Zhongli and fuck him silly. \r\n\r\nStupid horny thoughts. Stupid dick. Stupid contract. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTartaglia,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI sincerely hope you’re not wreaking havoc where you are, although considering it’s you… Whatever. Just don’t do anything to embarrass the Tsaritsa any more than you already have.\r\n\r\nI’ve heard news that your family is now in Liyue with you. Don’t get distracted with trivial matters. You’re not there on a holiday.\r\n\r\nSo far, we haven’t received any new leads regarding the other Archons. For now, stay where you are and wait for further instructions when we need you. Keep an eye on Morax in case he does anything suspicious. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nScaramouche\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChilde rolls his eyes and waves the letter in front of a candle, watching as the corners catch fire. What was even the point of Scaramouche sending him this when Pulcinella already wrote one that literally said the same thing? \r\n\r\nScaramouche liked the sound of his own voice too much, and apparently, that translated into writing as well. \r\n\r\nBefore the letter disintegrates into ashes, Childe catches sight of the last paragraph. For now, stay where you are and wait for further instructions when we need you. \r\n\r\nIt’s a good reminder to himself that he won’t be in Liyue forever. As much as he’s grown attached to this place, he can’t stay here. He has his loyalties to uphold and his own home to return to.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he can’t stop himself from thinking about a certain ex-Geo Archon. \r\n\r\nThree days. It’s been three days since that happened. When Childe woke up the next day, Zhongli was already gone and he couldn’t help but feel like he’d been thrown aside after a one night stand—except no sex actually happened, and Zhongli probably doesn’t even know what the term ‘one night stand’ means. \r\n\r\nUgh, what a mess. \r\n\r\nAnd so, since he’s determined not to delve further into whatever happened between him and Zhongli, Childe has been busying himself with work. Specifically, he’s been debt collecting and taking his frustrations out on the poor idiots who try to avoid paying their loans. He finds out very quickly that it’s a good stress reliever. Fun, even.\r\n\r\nHe’s not exactly avoiding Zhongli, but he’s not seeking him out either. Luckily, his family hasn’t insisted on seeing his fake boyfriend for a while. Part of Childe hopes that this means they’ve stopped obsessing over it and they won’t have to do anything else with this fake relationship. \r\n\r\nThe other part… Well, the other part is stupid because it’s gutted about the fact he won’t need a reason to see Zhongli. \r\n\r\nNot that he ever needed a reason to see Zhongli to begin with… Still, he can’t ignore the fact that things are different now. No complications or feelings, my ass, he bitterly thinks. Childe has really dug himself into a hole this time. \r\n\r\nFucking Tsaritsa, he’s started thinking about it again. No, this won’t do. He needs to distract himself. More debt collecting is in order today, or maybe he should find Lumine and see if she needs help beating up anyone…\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLumine is nowhere to be found in Liyue. Childe suspects the strange traveller is either in Mondstadt, or she’s flinging herself down more waterfalls to deliver food to people. Or both. Lumine did tell him once that she sometimes delivers food for a restaurant owner named Sara there. Why her customers are waiting by waterfalls or cliffs, Childe will never know. \r\n\r\nWell, since Lumine isn’t around for Childe to pester, it looks like he’ll just collect more debts today. \r\n\r\n“How’s my favourite Northland Bank receptionist?” Childe says as soon as he enters the bank. \r\n\r\nEkaterina glances up at him from her desk. “Sir, I am the only Northland Bank receptionist.”\r\n\r\nHe winks at her. “And that’s why we love you.”\r\n\r\nShe sighs and resumes flickering through the pile of papers in front of her. Come to think of it, it’s a very large pile of papers and Childe doesn’t think he’s ever seen the receptionist look so stressed before. \r\n\r\nHe stops by her desk. It\'s only now that he notices there are a number of Fatui recruits within the bank. All of them seem to be on edge, muttering amongst each other. Usually, they try not to station too many Fatui inside the bank; while Northland Bank is becoming more and more popular with the Liyuens, many of them are still wary of the Fatui. \r\n\r\nFortunately, there are no customers inside the bank at this time, but it’s obvious now that something is amiss. \r\n\r\n“What’s wrong?” Childe asks. \r\n\r\n“It’s strange. Our records from last month came back… There’s been large withdrawals being made, but no records of who is taking the Mora, or where it’s going.”\r\n\r\nEkaterina slides a sheet to him and Childe takes a brief second to skim through it. As she explained, there are large deductions of Mora from their vaults. Normally, everything is sourced in their records to keep track of where their money is going; it makes it much easier to hunt down customers when they need to. \r\n\r\nChilde hums to himself, then pushes the sheet back to Ekaterina. “So, what you’re saying is that someone’s been stealing from the bank.”\r\n\r\n“It’s possible but our security is immaculate. I cannot imagine that anyone would be able to breach it.”\r\n\r\nTrue. They have Fatui stationed around the vaults if anyone dared to steal from them. Besides, Childe always thought the rumours surrounding the Northland Bank was enough to scare potential thieves away. He thought wrong. \r\n\r\n“When did this start?”\r\n\r\nEkaterina purses her lips as she trails her finger down the records. “It was happening quite frequently last month… but it’s stopped since last week.” She frowns, leaning closer to the sheet as if it would help make more sense of the numbers. “That’s peculiar. It stopped around the same time we changed the codes for the vault.”\r\n\r\nChilde scratches his head. “Okay, so whoever is stealing from the bank somehow knew our old codes, and now that we’ve changed them, they’ve been unable to steal from us again?”\r\n\r\n“The vaults are very intricate… Not just anyone will be able to unlock them, let alone breach our security.”\r\n\r\nWho could possibly have enough balls to steal from the bank, and not just any bank but a bank controlled by the Fatui? Most of the customers they hunt down almost faint on the spot the moment they see the Fatui have come to collect their debts.\r\n\r\nChilde thinks back on all the people they’ve had to collect debts from. A lot of them are greedy merchants trying to use their loans to expand their business. Although… there’s also those who go to that place.\r\n\r\n“It could be someone from the Pearl Galley again. People there are always using our loans to pay off their visits,” Childe suggests. \r\n\r\nIt’s one of the funniest things Childe remembers about the bank. When the Tsaritsa first sent him to Liyue, it only took a week for him to notice that a lot of their men were being sent to the Galley to dispose of customers. Once he realised the Pearl Galley actually served as both a brothel and a casino, everything suddenly made sense…\r\n\r\n“It’s funny that you should mention that… There are rumours that there have been two deaths related to the Pearl Galley as of recently.” Ekaterina glances around, as if making sure there are no customers to hear them despite the bank currently being empty. “They were not our doing. It was the escorts who were murdered. The first death was… last week. And the most recent one was yesterday.”\r\n\r\nThat’s… unexpected. “What? You think they\'re linked?”\r\n\r\nThe receptionist shrugs. “Maybe… The deaths started occurring around the time money was no longer being stolen from us. And from the looks of it, the culprit stopped stealing because they are now unable to open our vaults. Perhaps they were using the money to enjoy themselves at the Pearl Galley, but resorted to murdering its escorts once they no longer had the funds to afford them?”\r\n\r\n“Wow.” Childe whistles. “This is why you\'re our favourite Northland Bank receptionist.”\r\n\r\nEkaterina’s lips tug up into a rare smile. “I was under the impression it was because I\'m the only Northland Bank receptionist.”\r\n\r\n“That too.”\r\n\r\nShe laughs under her breath. In less than a second, all signs of emotion disappear from her face and she’s back to being serious. “Of course, the two incidents could be completely unrelated but it is worth looking at.”\r\n\r\n“Okay. Have their bodies been retrieved?”\r\n\r\n“They should be in the Wangsheng Funeral Parlour.”\r\n\r\nOf course they would be. Childe’s thoughts instantly travel to a certain consultant who should be there right now… Looks like he can’t avoid him forever. \r\n\r\nHe nods. “Let me look into this then.”\r\n\r\nBefore he leaves, Ekaterina coughs loudly. Very loudly. “Sir. Please refrain from causing a scene in the Pearl Galley. Discretion is absolutely vital. It is already a miracle you are still able to remain in Liyue after what you did last time.”\r\n\r\nChilde waves a hand, already one foot out of the door. “I’m always discreet.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs soon as Childe steps into the parlour, he’s greeted by the incarnation of evil—according to almost every Liyuen he comes across, anyway. Then again, they probably say the same for him too. \r\n\r\nHu Tao grins at him from where she’s sitting. He waves at her, scanning the room for any sign of Zhongli. \r\n\r\n“Hello, lover boy. Come to visit your fiancé?”\r\n\r\n“He’s not my… Eh, whatever.” Fiancé, boyfriend, lover… What difference does it make? They’re all fake anyway. “Yes, yes, I have.”\r\n\r\nThe short girl motions towards one of the rooms to his right. “He’s back there examining a new corpse. Don’t distract him too much, and no funny business! I’ve seen that hickey you put on his neck… How scandalous.”\r\n\r\nChilde sincerely hopes he’s not blushing. The shit-eating grin spreading across Hu Tao’s face tells him there’s a possibility that he is. \r\n\r\n“Ugh,” is the only coherent response he can think of. He’s really not well equipped to deal with people teasing him about this fake relationship. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Hu Tao is ruthless. She sits up on her chair and smirks into her hands. “Go easy on him, okay? Zhongli may look young but I have a feeling he\'s much older than he lets on…”\r\n\r\nChilde narrows his eyes. Surely she doesn’t know that…?\r\n\r\nHu Tao laughs. “Heh. Just kidding!”\r\n\r\nChilde is starting to understand why even Zhongli’s immaculate patience cannot handle Hu Tao. He sighs, deciding it’s not worth carrying on this conversation. He came here for Fatui business, not to be teased by a girl half his size.\r\n\r\nAs Hu Tao mentioned, Zhongli is examining a corpse when Childe walks into the room. Clearly Childe is the last person Zhongli expected today from the way his eyebrows raise up as soon as he sees him. \r\n\r\nThey stare at each other. Childe was hoping this visit won\'t be awkward at all, and yet the more seconds that pass between them in silence, the more he realises awkwardness might be futile. \r\n\r\nZhongli takes a step forward. “Childe. Good afternoon.”\r\n\r\nChilde forces out a smile. “Hey.” \r\n\r\nHe was supposed to delve right into his investigation, but one look at Zhongli and suddenly his brain has blanked out. The hickey on Zhongli’s neck has faded by now, as if it had never been there to begin with. Childe is ashamed to admit he first reacts to this with disappointment but he quickly squashes those inappropriate thoughts away. \r\n\r\nFor once, Zhongli isn’t wearing his coat—most likely because Childe singed it with his delusion during their spar last time. Shit, Childe was going to get a new coat tailored for him. He had completely forgotten about it.\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” Childe blurts out. “About your coat.”\r\n\r\nZhongli blinks. “My coat?”\r\n\r\n“I burnt it during our spar last time, remember? I was going to get a new one made for you, actually…”\r\n\r\n“Oh.” To Childe’s surprise, Zhongli lets out a short laugh. “There is no need for you to do that.”\r\n\r\nHe turns around and pulls at something draped over a chair. When Childe gets a better look, he sees that it’s Zhongli’s coat, minus the singed ends. \r\n\r\n“I have another one just like it,” Zhongli explains. “I had it made by a travelling tailor who was staying in Liyue for a few months. She suggested that it would be best if I owned two versions, should something happen to the other one…”\r\n\r\nMaybe she just wanted more money out of you—or the person who was paying for you, Childe thinks. Because he’s the best fake boyfriend ever, he doesn’t say it out loud. \r\n\r\n“Therefore, you do not need to get me a new coat,” Zhongli tells him, draping the coat back over his chair. “But the thought is appreciated.”\r\n\r\nChilde nods. “Okay. Um.” Back on track. He was supposed to talk to Zhongli about the corpses, not his wardrobe. “Are you busy?”\r\n\r\n“Hmm. Did you need anything?”\r\n\r\n“This may be an odd question, but have you received corpses from the Pearl Galley recently?”\r\n\r\nZhongli motions towards the body he’d been examining earlier. “This one. Evidently murdered.”\r\n\r\nChilde walks closer, frowning at the corpse before them. The first thing he notices is that their throat is slashed; most likely the cause of their death. The second thing he notices is that it’s not just a slashed throat; the cut is so deep he can see bone underneath. Any deeper and this would be a beheaded body. \r\n\r\nConsidering it’s not beheaded, Childe doubts the killer’s purpose was to cut the throat this deep. Most likely, they weren’t aware of their own strength or they’re used to battles that require more. \r\n\r\n“It\'s just like the other corpse I saw here the other day. That one had their arm cut off. I remember thinking it was impressive since your average citizen can’t do that...” he says. “Whoever is killing these people is experienced in battle.”\r\n\r\nZhongli rubs his chin and stares up, deep in thought. “The other body you are mentioning… That also came from the Pearl Galley.”\r\n\r\n“That… makes sense, actually.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any reason why you are asking about this?”\r\n\r\nChilde contemplates whether he should tell Zhongli or not. Really, he came here to examine the corpses himself, and he is trying to limit his interactions with the consultant until he can shake certain thoughts off his head… \r\n\r\nWell, easier said than done. Now that he’s here, staying away from Zhongli is an impossible task to return to. He naturally gravitates towards Zhongli, already thinking of several questions to catch up with him during their time away from each other. \r\n\r\nNo time for that, he reminds himself. If he’s going to talk with Zhongli, he may as well explain the situation to him… \r\n\r\n“Miss Ekaterina’s theory is plausible, however it is only a theory,” Zhongli says once he’s finished summarising Northland Bank’s current predicament. “If you were to investigate the Pearl Galley, it could be that the murderer is not the thief from the Northland Bank.”\r\n\r\nChilde leans against the table behind him, taking care not to knock over the large pile of books atop it. \r\n\r\n“I know, I know, but it’s the only lead I have,” he says, watching as Zhongli carefully covers the corpse with a sheet. “Besides, an unknown murderer prowling through Liyue… Isn’t that exciting?”\r\n\r\nZhongli glances at him from the corner of his eyes. “That is not the word I would use to describe it,” he mutters, not at all amused. “But if we are to investigate the ship, you will need to be in disguise. Many in the Galley are wary that Fatui are the reason why patrons disappear once they are unable to pay back the rest of their loans. If the thief is indeed within the ship, then your presence may scare them away.”\r\n\r\nHuh. He didn’t think of that. Honestly, Childe’s plan so far has been: \r\n\r\nInvestigate the corpses.\r\nGo to the Galley.\r\nFind the culprit and fight them. \r\nNow that he thinks about it, that’s a very vague plan with a lot of room for error, but he had a similar approach when he was trying to steal Zhongli’s gnosis and that somehow worked out in the end. Childe is never one for elaborate schemes; he likes to dive in head first and fight the people he needs to fight. It works. Usually. \r\n\r\nAnyway, surely it can’t be that difficult to find a killer in a brothel? \r\n\r\n“Good point,” he says, then frowns. “What do you mean ‘we’?”\r\n\r\nZhongli smiles at him. “I will go with you. I am a frequent visitor of the Galley.”\r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t think he heard that properly. \r\n\r\nZhongli… Frequent visitor of the Galley… which is also a brothel...\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Wait, brother, we need to take a picture! Smile for the kamera!”\r\n\r\nChilde is attacked by a blazing flash of light before he can even register half of that sentence. While he’s temporarily blind, he hears his siblings giggling amidst the nonstop clicking. Little devils…\r\n\r\nAfter Tonia is finished with her kamera assault, she shows him the pictures; all ten of them with him looking like he’s being attacked by the sun. \r\n\r\n“Mother says she wants to send these pictures to Brother Alek!” Tonia says.\r\n\r\nChilde frowns. First of all, you can barely see his face with how bright the flash is; and secondly… Alek? Childe hasn’t seen his eldest sibling since… since forever. \r\n\r\n“Him? I think the last time I saw him, I was still wearing diapers. Does he even remember me?” he asks, struggling to put a face on his sibling. Alek is ten years older than him; as far as Childe can remember, he was already married with a family of his own when Childe enlisted into the Fatui.\r\n\r\nAnthon nods. “He writes to us almost as much as you do, Brother!”\r\n\r\n“But he never sends us any toys…” Teucer adds with a small pout. \r\n\r\n“He said that if you and Mr. Zhongli ever get married for real, he’ll attend the wedding!” Tonia says. Before Childe can remind them he is not marrying Zhongli, she takes several more pictures. \r\n\r\n“Alright, alright, that’s enough pictures for now,” he says, reaching for the kamera. He’s going to lose his eyesight at this rate. “Zhongli’s waiting for me in the lounge.”\r\n\r\nTheir plan to investigate the Pearl Galley is to be set in motion tonight. As luck would have it, there is an opera viewing later on, which hopefully means more patrons will attend. Since Zhongli is apparently a frequent and highly regarded visitor of the Galley, they don’t need a special invitation. \r\n\r\n(Childe is still in shock over that. Coupled with Zhongli’s casual proposal of being friends with benefits, he’s starting to wonder if Zhongli isn’t as… uptight as he seems to be. Tsaritsa. Just thinking about it is enough to drive him insane. No. No, he should stop thinking about it.)\r\n\r\nHe walks into the lounge and instantly spots his fake boyfriend. A smile makes its way onto his face when he sees the gigantic bouquet of flowers Zhongli is holding, exactly like the first time he met Childe’s family. \r\n\r\n“Thank you,” Childe says, hefting the bouquet into his arms. Archons, this thing is even heavier than the last one. He leans in to kiss Zhongli on the cheek, lingering longer than necessary until the sensible voice inside his head starts yelling at him to pull back. \r\n\r\n“Let me find a vase for that,” Childe’s mother says, popping up in the middle of nowhere to snatch the bouquet from his grasp. \r\n\r\nOnce she leaves, Childe takes a moment to admire how Zhongli looks—and damn, he looks good. As Zhongli suggested, it would be best if Childe wore different clothes for tonight, in order to avoid the patrons from recognising him as being part of the Fatui. At first, Zhongli wanted him to wear a hanfu and Childe tried on many variations of the robes before deciding it would be too difficult to fight in them should they need to. \r\n\r\nIn the end, they decided that wearing a changshan would be the best option. It was a traditional Liyuen dress worn by men, resembling a long tunic; not quite as elaborate as hanfu but at least much easier to move around in. \r\n\r\nThe one Childe is wearing is a rich navy colour, decorated with detailed golden patterns along one side; unlike Zhongli’s, his changshan stops by his waist rather than below his knees, and is paired with black pants. It’s not as comfortable to move around in as his normal attire, but it will do. For obvious reasons, he’s not wearing his Fatui mask tonight. Instead, his hair has been styled by his over-enthusiastic mother and sister, slicked back on one side and his bangs combed away from his eyes for once.\r\n\r\nZhongli told him he would wear something similar, but nothing could have prepared Childe for this. The burgundy changshan he’s wearing fits him like a glove, making it impossible for the Harbinger to ignore how slender his waist is. There are golden patterns adorning the dress in the form of a dragon surrounded by swirling flames, but, really, Childe can barely focus on what the outfit looks like when Zhongli looks amazing in anything. \r\n\r\n“You look... “ Childe swallows, scrambling for a suitable description. “Good.”\r\n\r\nZhongli beams at him. “As do you. The clothes suit you very much.”\r\n\r\nJust then, Childe’s mother materialises between them again. She dusts off Childe’s shoulders and straightens his jacket. \r\n\r\n“He looks very handsome, doesn’t he, Mr. Zhongli?” she says. “Ajax, I love your hair like this… You should style it like this more often; your hair is always such a mess.”\r\n\r\nChilde feigns a distraught expression, clutching his chest. “You wound me, Mother.”\r\n\r\nHis father laughs. “Are you two going on a date?”\r\n\r\nZhongli nods. “Yes, I am taking Ajax to watch an opera with me.”\r\n\r\nAmong other things, Childe mentally adds. Like hunting down a murderer in a brothel. \r\n\r\n“The fact you can actually convince Ajax to watch opera is impressive enough, Mr. Zhongli.”\r\n\r\n“Hey, I don’t mind watching opera…” Childe mumbles to his father. “I appreciate the arts too.”\r\n\r\nHis mother tidies his hair for the hundredth time tonight and kisses him on the cheek. “Have fun, you two. Mr. Zhongli, please keep him out of trouble.”\r\n\r\nEver the gentleman, Zhongli nods and offers his parents the most charming smile known to all of Teyvat. “I will try.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as they’re out of the house, Childe throws his head back and laughs. “You’re a big liar, consultant; telling my poor parents you’ll keep me out of trouble when you’re taking me out for a night at the brothel.”\r\n\r\nZhongli laughs with him, much quieter but enough to send Childe’s stomach somersaulting in circles. The consultant reaches for his hand, squeezing it, and Childe’s heart joins along with the gymnastics. \r\n\r\n“I believe I told them that I would try,” Zhongli says, completely unaware of the effect he has. “You and I both know it is impossible to keep you out of trouble.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChilde has never been at the Pearl Galley before but he’s heard enough stories to know it’s one of the most extravagant spots in Liyue. Whenever he gazes down at the harbour from his rooftop, he’d see the grandiose ship sailing in the distance, so out of place among Liyue’s calm waters. \r\n\r\nNow that he’s here, he’s not at all surprised by how it looks. It is every bit as gaudy as he expected. He can see why so many of their customers easily spend ridiculous amounts  of Mora on this place. \r\n\r\n“Zhongli!” someone calls. Childe turns around and spots a middle-aged Liyuen man with a goatee, followed by another man whose hairline is receding. He has quite an impressive moustache though. \r\n\r\n“It is good to see you here,” the man with the goatee says to Zhongli, then turns to Childe with obvious curiosity in his eyes. \r\n\r\nZhongli smiles at him and politely bows. “Good evening, Hanxue. This is Ajax. He is my… lover.”\r\n\r\nThe moustached man starts choking. “Lover?!” He coughs, lowering his voice. “Excuse me, I did not mean to yell… I\'m just surprised.”\r\n\r\nYou and everyone else, Childe thinks, resisting the urge to sigh. \r\n\r\n“I heard rumours that our dear consultant was engaged to someone a few days ago, but I didn’t know it was actually real…” the man called Hanxue mutters, narrowing his eyes at Childe. \r\n\r\nChilde fakes his friendliest smile and grabs Zhongli by the hand. “Yes, Zhongli and I are madly in love and we can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives together. Isn’t that right…” He freezes, thinking back to all the cringey pet names his brother Taras used to call one of his girlfriends. “...Babe?” \r\n\r\nZhongli has the courtesy to look amused. “Very much so.”\r\n\r\n“How adorable. It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ajax. I am Hanxue, and this is Yixuan. We are both archeologists; Zhongli often debates with us during our visits here.” Hanxue rubs his chin, still narrowing his eyes at Childe. From the corner of his eyes, he can see Zhongli’s shoulders are tense. “Hmm… Have you been here long, Ajax? I feel as if I have seen you before…”\r\n\r\nChilde quickly shakes his head. “Um, I’m afraid I can’t stay in Liyue often… I visit whenever I can to see Zhongli, but work requires me to be in Snezhnaya a lot…”\r\n\r\n“Yes, perhaps you mistook Ajax for someone else?” Zhongli adds. “There is a rising number of Snezhnayans staying in Liyue these days.”\r\n\r\nThankfully, Hanxue nods, although Childe can tell he’s still trying to remember where he’s seen him before. “That must be it… Oh, I think the opera is starting. Consultant, we have a table already reserved. You and Ajax must join us.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. We will,” Zhongli says. \r\n\r\nChilde breathes a sigh of relief when the two men leave to sit by their table. Maybe he should have done something to change the colour of his hair for a better disguise; there’s not many gingers walking around Liyue these days after all.\r\n\r\nHe pulls Zhongli close, lowering his voice into a whisper. “I don’t think they believe we’re together.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm. I suppose it is difficult to believe when they have never seen me romantically involved with anyone else,” Zhongli muses. “We will have to be more convincing.”\r\n\r\n“Right…” Childe looks over his shoulder, quickly scanning their surroundings. “See anyone suspicious yet?”\r\n\r\n“It will be easier to spot the potential culprit once the escorts are here… We can gauge their interactions.”\r\n\r\n“Alright, when do they come out?”\r\n\r\nZhongli links his arm around Childe’s and smiles at someone walking past them. “In the Pearl Galley, most prefer to enjoy the opera first. Afterwards, we feast, and that is usually when the escorts grace us with their presence.”\r\n\r\n“And the escorts… They…”\r\n\r\nAs if knowing the course of his thoughts, Zhongli’s eyes soften with amusement and he lets out a quiet laugh. \r\n\r\n“Pursuing sex with an escort here is rare and frowned upon. They are sought for their intellect rather than their bodies,” he explains. “Here, they mostly dance and sing, or recite poetry. It is usually the escort’s decision if she wishes to bed someone, and that person must also be able to afford such a large price.”\r\n\r\nOh. Huh. Childe never knew that. He nods. “You come here a lot…”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s smile widens. “Not for reasons you think. A few have invited me here in the past. It is more for… socialising events.”\r\n\r\n“When you said you were a frequent visitor here, I was under the impression you came to see the escorts.”\r\n\r\n“No, Ajax. As I said, I only come here to socialise with friends. The escorts here are beautiful and very talented, but I am not interested in such things,” Zhongli says. “Come, let’s not keep them waiting.”\r\n\r\nChilde tries, and fails, to ignore the relief that courses through him at those words. Smiling to himself, he pulls Zhongli closer, secretly enjoying the way their bodies slot together. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTen minutes after the opera begins, Childe realises he may have been lying to his father. He can appreciate the arts… when they’re not about to make him fall asleep. He stifles a yawn behind his hand, wondering if anyone will notice if he takes a small nap on the table. Their seats are near the back; hardly anyone can see them from here… \r\n\r\nApart from one person, anyway. Childe feels Hanxue’s eyes trained on him at all times. Come to think of it, he’s watching Childe more than the opera.\r\n\r\nHe leans into Zhongli. “That man keeps watching us.”\r\n\r\nZhongli moves his chair closer. “I have noticed.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he’s the culprit?”\r\n\r\n“No... I think he is mostly suspicious that we do not seem to be acting like a couple.”\r\n\r\nChilde pretends to lean back, watching Hanxue from the corner of his eyes. As expected, the archeologist is staring at them from behind his fan. Everyone else is far too busy watching the opera or enjoying their drinks. \r\n\r\n“Well, let’s give him something to convince him then,” he mutters. \r\n\r\nHe’s not sure what possesses him to do this. In retrospect, he’ll blame the atmosphere of the Galley for his inappropriate actions. Childe pulls Zhongli onto his lap, holding onto his waist to steady him when Zhongli jolts out of shock. Before he can chicken out, he trails his lips along Zhongli’s neck and begins to suck. \r\n\r\nZhongli freezes against him, grabbing his hand. \r\n\r\nChilde stops. “No?” he murmurs into his neck. “Too much?”\r\n\r\nSilence. Childe is about to pull away and apologise when Zhongli shifts on his lap, pressing himself closer. He squeezes his hand. \r\n\r\n“Carry on,” he whispers. \r\n\r\nChilde thinks he’s about to combust right there and then. \r\n\r\nHe closes his eyes and bites Zhongli’s neck, smiling when the ex-Archon shudders against him. As an apology, Childe swirls his tongue over the same spot, round and round, round and round, until Zhongli begins to squirm. He sucks, hard, determined to create a new mark to replace the one that’s faded away. \r\n\r\nIt’s not long until the sound of the opera is forgotten and all Childe can focus on is the man on his lap. He kisses up and down Zhongli’s neck, peppering him with new marks to remind everyone in Liyue he is taken. Once he’s satisfied, Childe opens his eyes and gazes at his partner. Zhongli’s head dips to the side, eyes closed, lips parted and red. Tempting. \r\n\r\nGods, he\'s beautiful. He\'s always thought Zhongli is beautiful, but there\'s something addicting in seeing him react like this to every touch Childe offers him. It makes him want to see more. Do more.\r\n\r\nChilde licks along the shell of his ear, stopping to suck his earlobe, catching it between his teeth. He’s answered by a quiet hiss as Zhongli squeezes his eyes tighter, shuffling back on Childe’s lap. \r\n\r\nFuck. \r\n\r\nHe wraps his arms around Zhongli’s waist, keeping him in place. The more Zhongli squirms, the more it’s apparent that Childe is hard. And Zhongli isn’t helping by grinding his ass right where his dick is. \r\n\r\nFuck. \r\n\r\nThis is maddening. Zhongli is warm and pliant against him, and Childe’s hands are already moving by themselves. One of them slides up to cover his mouth, muffling the ex-Archon’s gasps as they get louder and louder by the second. The other trails down, past Zhongli’s stomach,  between his thighs, and presses against the evident bulge under his clothes as well. \r\n\r\nZhongli arches against him, panting. Childe shoves a thumb into his mouth and— fuck. His dick hardens even more the second he feels Zhongli sucking his thumb, swirling his tongue around it as if it’s his favourite treat. \r\n\r\nWhat the fuck, Childe thinks. What the fuck. \r\n\r\nHe groans, unable to stop himself from rutting into Zhongli’s ass. Fuck, this is too much. They should stop. He should stop. \r\n\r\nInstead, Childe’s hand strokes Zhongli through his clothes, pleased to find that the ex-Archon is just as hard as he is. \r\n\r\n“Fuck—Zhongli,” Childe rasps into his ear. He slides his hand under Zhongli’s changshan and squeezes him through his pants, enjoying the way the ex-Archon whines instantly—\r\n\r\nSomeone coughs. Loudly. \r\n\r\nZhongli is out of his lap and back on his own stool in the blink of an eye. Childe shrinks back, purposely hiding from the scandalised eyes who have probably witnessed their little… moment. Shit. They took that way too far. \r\n\r\nWell. At least everyone in the Galley is convinced they’re a couple now, albeit a very inappropriate and shameless couple, but a couple nonetheless. \r\n\r\nToo bad Childe is far too hard and horny to care at the moment. Maybe, when he’s back in the confines of his own bed, he’ll think back on this public indecency and hope for the Abyss to swallow him whole. \r\n\r\nFor now, he sneaks a glance at Zhongli. The consultant stares back at him, his eyes filled with amusement, and his lips begging to be kissed. \r\n\r\nFuck. Childe presses the heel of his palm against his dick and tries to think of anything to kill his boner. Think of the reason why he’s in the Galley in the first place. Think of dead escorts and murderers, not pretty ex-Archons he wants to ravish. Think of dead escorts and murderers…\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe opera is long enough for Childe’s poor boner to eventually die down. This is the second time his dick has been left a victim of blue balls, and both times it’s been Zhongli’s fault. Childe isn’t sure if he can survive at this rate. He’s half tempted to find the nearest bathroom and jerk off, but then he remembers he’s supposed to be looking for a murderer, not letting his fake boyfriend/lover/fiancé turn him into a sex maniac. \r\n\r\nGods, how did he even end up in this predicament? \r\n\r\nThink of dead escorts and murderers. Please, for the love of the fucking Tsaritsa, just find the murderer.\r\n\r\nChilde wonders how he still has a voice in his head that’s somewhat sensible, and why this voice won’t take action when he needs it to stop him from making dumb decisions. \r\n\r\nAfter the opera is finished, Zhongli disappears to talk to his friends. Childe is left alone to amble around the tables, scrutinising every patron for any sign that will scream MURDERER to him. So far, none, but he does come across someone he does not expect to find. \r\n\r\nA Snezhnayan man. His eyes widen as soon as he sees Childe. \r\n\r\n“A fellow Snezhnayan! Greetings, friend!” he says, patting the seat next to his own. “Have a drink next to me. I’m Maksim.”\r\n\r\nWhile there are a few Snezhnayans in Liyue, Childe never expected to find one here in the Galley. Then again, considering how popular brothels are back in their home land, he really shouldn’t be surprised. This man has red hair like he does, slicked back, although not quite as bright. He wears a typical Snezhnayan long coat with gloves, completely standing out like a sore thumb within all the other patrons in the Galley.\r\n\r\nChilde accepts the drink he kindly offers and sits down next to him, “I\'m Ajax. Thanks.”\r\n\r\nMaksim grins at him. “The Pearl Galley truly is as wonderful as they say. The men are striking, and the women exquisite…” He lowers his voice, leaning closer to Childe. “I see you were enjoying yourself earlier.”\r\n\r\nChilde hides the blush spreading on his face by drinking his wine. “You saw that?”\r\n\r\n“Who didn’t?” Maksim laughs and twists in his chair to look at Zhongli from across the ship. He takes a sip of his wine, nodding at Childe. “Is he one of the escorts? He’s beautiful; you must have spent quite a lot on him.”\r\n\r\nThe wine suddenly tastes unpleasant. Childe is unable to stop the frown tugging on his eyebrows. \r\n\r\n“I didn’t pay for him. He’s mine.” He coughs. “I mean, he’s my fiancé. He\'s… He\'s not an escort.”\r\n\r\nHe’s surprised by the possessive anger that grips him out of nowhere. It doesn’t calm down until Maksim finally takes his eyes off Zhongli, turning back to face Childe. \r\n\r\n“What brings you to Liyue?” Childe asks, plastering on the fakest smile he can muster. Maksim, thankfully, did not notice his little slip of anger. \r\n\r\n“I originally intended to do business here in Liyue, although I must say that I have forgotten all such thoughts already… How about you?”\r\n\r\nChilde drinks the rest of his wine and watches Zhongli talking to his friends from the other side of the Galley. His gaze roams down his figure, fixating too long on the slender curve of his waist. Even in a ship filled with beautifully dressed escorts, Zhongli still stands out the most amongst them. \r\n\r\n“I just came here to visit my fiancé,” he mutters, tearing his gaze away from the consultant. “I, uh, I’m mostly in Snezhnaya but I find time to visit him whenever I can.”\r\n\r\n“I see… You’re a very lucky man.” Maksim downs the rest of his drink and sits back on his chair. His eyes remains on Childe for far too long; long enough for Childe to feel uncomfortable. “You know, I can’t shake off the feeling I’ve seen you before.”\r\n\r\nChilde laughs humourlessly. “Are you sure you’re not just missing home?”\r\n\r\nMaksim laughs it off as well and goes back to drinking some more. They engage in further small talk, mostly started by the tipsy Snezhnayan while Childe comes up with fake answers to appease him.\r\n\r\nWhy would Maksim think he’d seen Childe before? Childe may be infamous around Liyue for his past crimes, but only a handful had ever seen his face in person. Most recognise him by his Fatui mask… \r\n\r\nLiyuens aside, Childe is used to people recognising him for other reasons. His name is well known across the Fatui, especially among new recruits who think stories of his battles are something to be greatly admired. Sometimes, he’s required to talk to these new groups in order to boost their morale and introduce them to the rules and regulations within the organization. \r\n\r\nChilde eyes the empty wine cup in front of him. He spares one final glance at Maksim before stretching his arms, intentionally knocking the cup over. \r\n\r\nMaksim’s hand darts to catch it before it hits the floor. Childe didn’t even see him move. \r\n\r\nHe bites back the smile threatening to spread on his face. Gotcha, he thinks. This guy is definitely Fatui. \r\n\r\n“Woah, you moved faster than lightning,” he says, feigning shock. \r\n\r\nMaksim chuckles and slides the cup back onto the table. “You break that and you’ll have to pay for it, my friend. Who knows how expensive those things are?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” Childe says. He rises to his feet, pretending to yawn. “I should get back to my fiancé.”\r\n\r\n“See you around. It was nice talking to you.”\r\n\r\nChilde nods and smiles at the man for the last time. “You too.”\r\n\r\nAs he walks away, he tries to piece together all of the clues flying about his head. Generally, Fatui aren’t able to leave without direct permission from the Tsaritsa, and most do not dare disappoint her. If Maksim recognised him, then that could only mean he saw him from one of those introductory speeches Harbingers are required to give. \r\n\r\nBut why would he be in the Galley, avoiding his duties as Fatui? Clearly, he’s not here on duty either, by the looks of him drinking away at his table and conversing with several escorts at his side. \r\n\r\n“Ajax, is something the matter?” \r\n\r\nChilde looks up, faced with evident concern flickering through Zhongli’s eyes. He grabs Zhongli by the elbow and pulls him to a corner, away from everyone else.\r\n\r\n“I think that guy’s Fatui…” Childe mutters, nodding towards Maksim’s direction. “He recognised me.”\r\n\r\nZhongli steps closer. To others, it may look as if they’re about to have yet another show of public indecency, but luckily for them, most of the patrons are now too drunk to care. Childe rubs a hand up and down Zhongli’s spine, pulling him in to rest his head along his shoulder. \r\n\r\nHe breathes him in. Zhongli’s scent has been haunting his room ever since he stayed there, burying its way into his blanket, his pillows, everywhere. \r\n\r\n“I saw what you did with the cup,” Zhongli says, his breath tickling Childe’s neck. “Very smart.”\r\n\r\nChilde chuckles. “See? I’m not so stupid after all.”\r\n\r\nHe stiffens when he feels Zhongli’s lips press into his neck. Soft, cautious. Then, his mouth parts, tongue darting out to draw circles along Childe’s skin.\r\n\r\n“You are not stupid,” Zhongli tells him. Childe has completely forgotten what the hell they were talking about to begin with.\r\n\r\nZhongli presses closer to him until there’s no space between their bodies. He runs his fingers through Childe’s hair, combing the strands back. All the while, his lips continue to trail down Childe’s neck, alternating between gentle kisses to sucking at the skin until Childe’s fingers dig into his waist. It takes all of his mental strength to remain in place when all he can think of is pinning Zhongli against the nearest wall and ravaging him. \r\n\r\n“But...  I believe if that man is truly Fatui, then he could be a potential culprit…” Zhongli pulls back slightly. His nose bumps against Childe’s chin as he looks up. “Fatui would be able to breach Northland Bank’s security, no?”\r\n\r\nChilde can hardly focus on their conversation. He licks his dry lips and swallows. Hard. “You think he could be the one?”\r\n\r\nIt’s a miracle he can formulate words at this point. His brain turns to mush as Zhongli snakes his arms around his neck, pulling his head down. Murderer? What murderer? The only danger in this ship is apparently the man currently draped all over him. \r\n\r\n“Hmm.” Zhongli’s lips brush Childe’s ear. “I spoke with a few people too; many of them said that man has become a regular here at the Galley.”\r\n\r\nIt must be a cruel joke that Childe is this pent up and Zhongli’s here talking about another man in his ear. Whoever, or whatever is up in Celestia must be laughing at him right now. He closes his eyes and holds onto Zhongli’s waist, unsure as to whether this is torture or heaven. \r\n\r\n“According to them, the first escort that was murdered was quite a popular one… She was one of the few who would allow others to bed her, for a hefty price. In fact, she was often the reason why patrons here would borrow loans they cannot afford to pay back. Some of the patrons called her Xi Shi.”\r\n\r\nMost of that went straight through Childe’s head. \r\n\r\n“Xi Shi?” he says. It’s the only piece of information he managed to hold onto.\r\n\r\nZhongli hums. He leans back and presses his lips on Childe’s chin; fleeting, butterfly kisses that follow the path of his jaw. With every kiss he gives, Childe’s heart clenches to the point where he’s convinced he’s going to go into cardiac arrest any second now. \r\n\r\n“Yes. In traditional Liyuen stories, it is the name of a woman whose beauty was so great that, upon seeing her, fish forgot how to swim and sank below the surface. Likewise, it seems the men here have associated the escort’s overwhelming beauty and charm to be as dangerous.”\r\n\r\nChilde can think of a certain someone who fits that description very well. \r\n\r\nHe opens his eyes. Zhongli is now so close their noses almost touch. All of the extravagant lights and lanterns in the Galley make it look as if his hair is glowing and his eyes are other-worldly. \r\n\r\n“Wow,” Childe says with his last remaining brain cell. \r\n\r\nZhongli nods. “Exactly. Furthermore, the second victim was a maid, not another escort.”\r\n\r\nHe’s decided; this is torture. This is definitely torture. Damn it, he needs to focus on the conversation before he ends up having another boner in public because of Zhongli. \r\n\r\n“A maid?” Childe asks.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Zhongli says. He reaches up and sweeps back a strand of hair that was falling over Childe’s eyes. “I was told she was the one who found Xi Shi’s corpse.”\r\n\r\nChilde is both disappointed and relieved that Zhongli has stopped kissing him. Regardless, he’s not quite ready to let him go just yet. He keeps his arms wrapped around Zhongli’s waist, secretly pleased when the consultant holds onto his shoulders once again. \r\n\r\nHe could get used to this. Logically, Childe tells himself they’re only doing this to convince everyone in the Galley they’re a couple… but honestly it’s barely a priority to him and more an added bonus. \r\n\r\n“So she was killed because she found something that could have revealed the killer?” Childe suggests.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. In any case… we only have our suspicions, and we do not even know if the thief and the murderer are the same person… It will be difficult to prove if he’s the culprit or not.”\r\n\r\nCatching the culprit is literally the last thing on Childe’s mind. At least solving this case will convince the other Harbingers he’s not just lounging here in Liyue as many of them seem to think he is. \r\n\r\nHe sighs, searching the Galley for the suspicious Snezhnayan man. \r\n\r\nThere. Childe frowns, watching Maksim talk to the two guards outside the Galley’s entrance into the ship’s rooms. There’s a woman holding onto his arm, dressed in fine silks and her face painted with makeup. \r\n\r\nAnother escort, Childe concludes, and by the looks of it, they’re about to go inside. \r\n\r\nHe pulls away from Zhongli and grabs his hand. “Come on, let’s go inside as well.”\r\n\r\nZhongli frowns at him, then turns to see Maksim before he disappears into the ship’s interior. “Childe, I am aware that you prefer more… direct methods in gaining results, but we cannot—”\r\n\r\n“Come on, xiansheng, trust me, okay?” Childe urges. He squeezes his hand and tries his best to look as serious as possible.\r\n\r\nZhongli responds with a sigh of defeat. “Do not make me regret this.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChilde keeps his eyes on the escort in front of him, watching the dangling ornaments in her hair sway like a pendulum. Her hanfu is so long that Childe has to be careful to avoid stepping on it. She leads them deeper into the ship, unaware that with each step she takes, the couple behind her stalls further and further. \r\n\r\nOnce she rounds a corner, Childe pulls Zhongli with him to the opposite corridor, losing the escort. Fortunately, there seems to be no one else inside; everyone is behind closed doors, enjoying the company of other escorts. Considering there’s been two murders within this ship, Childe thought there would at least be guards here.\r\n\r\nGetting into the brothel took a huge chunk of his Mora. No wonder the patrons here are always getting into trouble with the bank. Fortunately for Childe, he’s never short on money. \r\n\r\nThey’re progressing with his plan fairly well; they’ve managed to get into the brothel without arousing any suspicion. Now, all they need to do is find Maksim. Somehow. \r\n\r\nHe only went in a few minutes before they did; surely he can’t have gone far?\r\n\r\n“This place is bigger than I expected. How are we supposed to know where he went?” Childe says. \r\n\r\nZhongli presses a finger to his lips. “Ssshh.”\r\n\r\nChilde freezes, and then—footsteps. To their right. \r\n\r\nHe exchanges looks with Zhongli for a brief second before both of them rush to hide behind a nearby pillar. \r\n\r\nOnce the footsteps recede, Childe peaks out, instantly spotting a tuft of ginger hair in the distance. Maksim. He glances over his shoulder to nod at Zhongli, then trails after the Snezhnayan man, making sure to keep his steps as quiet as possible. Stealth has never been his area of expertise; the other Harbingers are better at it. Besides, he’d much rather charge in and fight people. \r\n\r\nSadly, these corridors are far too cramped to fight in, and he promised Zhongli he’ll try to avoid trouble as much as he can; try being the keyword.\r\n\r\nMaksim leads them down another corridor, too engrossed in talking to the escort he’s with to notice who’s following him. It’ll be so easy to just sneak in and kill him from here, but they’re still not sure if he’s actually the—\r\n\r\nChilde’s foot catches on a rug. He stumbles, grabbing onto the wall to steady himself. While he avoids falling face first into the floor, the noise alerts the two in front of them. From the corner of his eyes, he sees Maksim turning around.\r\n\r\nChilde’s back hits a wall. He jolts, defences instantly raised up, wondering who pushed him—\r\n\r\nAnd then Zhongli’s lips are suddenly pressing into his, quickly, desperately, that Childe can’t fathom what the fuck is happening—only that Zhongli is still kissing him, prying his mouth open. \r\n\r\nChilde groans into the kiss and closes his eyes, greedily sucking Zhongli’s tongue. In the distance, he hears hushed voices, drowned out by the eager sounds of Zhongli gasping into his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Who are they? Should we call the guards?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, it’s just a lovesick couple. Let’s leave them alone.”\r\n\r\nMore footsteps; this time, fading away from them. \r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t care. He grabs Zhongli’s waist and flips them over. Their kiss is broken apart for the shortest of seconds as Zhongli’s back collides with the wall. His lips are red, swollen, and that’s all the temptation it takes for Childe to dive back in. \r\n\r\n“W-Wait… Wait, Childe…” Zhongli’s voice trails away as Childe sucks at his bottom lip, coaxing his mouth open. He moans, and conversation is lost as their tongues find each other. It’s a mess of a kiss, with their noses bumping, teeth clashing, and Childe trying to devour as much of Zhongli as he can. He can’t decide what’s more addicting; Zhongli’s taste or the little sounds escaping him. \r\n\r\nZhongli gasps. He angles his head away, breaking the kiss. Childe fixates on the string of saliva that hovers between them. “The… The man. We will lose him.”\r\n\r\nChilde couldn’t give a damn about that at this point. All he wants to do is lose himself in Zhongli.\r\n\r\n“Fuck,” is all he can say. \r\n\r\nBy some sort of miracle, he rips himself away from Zhongli. He doesn’t know how, and he doesn’t know why. For all he cares, Maksim can be the killer and he can steal more money from the bank. Sorry, Ekaterina.\r\n\r\nShit. \r\n\r\nOkay. Focus. \r\n\r\nHe coughs, straightening himself up. He makes a show of being too busy fixing his collar, when in reality he’s watching Zhongli’s every move. Once he’s sure he no longer has the urge to shove Zhongli back against the wall, he nods at him and resumes the task at hand. \r\n\r\nBefore they got… preoccupied with their kiss, Childe heard Maksim walking off. The only way in front of them is forward, therefore he follows the path and hopes he and Zhongli didn’t spend too long making out with each other to lose Maksim. Not that he regrets it. He definitely does not regret it. \r\n\r\nLuckily, they hear voices from one of the doors. Childe stops, pressing his ear against it. \r\n\r\nAs soon as he confirms it’s Maksim’s voice, he throws open the door and barges inside. \r\n\r\n“Childe, no—”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t really think about what would greet him the moment he went inside. He was dreading that Maksim would be having sex with the escort and he’d have to walk into that, but thankfully, there are no naked bodies in sight. Good.\r\n\r\nA high pitched scream follows shortly after. Clutching her chest, the escort throws herself against the wall. \r\n\r\nMaksim freezes. He takes one look at Childe before he lunges. \r\n\r\nOh. Childe was expecting some verbal confrontation and denial on Maksim’s part, but he can’t say he’s complaining about this development. He happily summons his hydro blades and blocks the man’s onslaught. From her corner, the escort screams some more and Childe notices that Zhongli has kindly surrounded her with his Jade shield. Ever the gentleman.\r\n\r\n“Childe!” he hears Zhongli calling. Within seconds, he’s surrounded by the familiar, golden glow of Zhongli’s shields, blocking out Maksim’s next attacks. \r\n\r\nClearly irritated, Maksim disappears into thin air. It would make any opponent panic, to have their enemy suddenly turn invisible, but Childe knows the Fatui’s fighting styles like the back of his hand. He doesn’t even bat an eyelid when Maksim dives at him from behind, surrounded by fire and a cyclone of blades.\r\n\r\nIt’s disappointingly boring fighting Maksim. After all this work in hunting him down, Childe’s body automatically moves to block his every attack, having memorised each and every one of the agent’s battle techniques. Maksim is beaten within a minute. Maybe even less. \r\n\r\nChilde kicks him onto the floor, keeping him down with his foot on his chest. \r\n\r\n“You stole the money and killed those two women, didn\'t you?” he goads, digging his foot harder. “No need to confess, I\'ll just beat the truth out of you if you don\'t.”\r\n\r\nMaksim glares up at him. “How did you know?”\r\n\r\nActually, I wasn’t sure, Childe mentally says. But thanks for confirming it. \r\n\r\nBefore he’s given a chance to celebrate this victory, the door bursts open. Several millelith guards come flooding in, pointing their spears at Childe. \r\n\r\n“It\'s him! That Fatui Harbinger!” one of them screams at the top of his lungs. “He must be the killer!”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“I told you to be discreet,” Ekaterina says. Even through her mask, Childe can picture the stern disappointment in her eyes, almost akin to a mother who just found out her son was causing trouble behind her back—only Ekaterina is about the same age as him. \r\n\r\nEven so, it’s difficult not to feel like a kid in trouble when you’re being dragged back to the Northland Bank by several millelith guards. Definitely not one of Childe’s finest moments, he’ll have to admit. \r\n\r\nChilde grimaces. “I was—”\r\n\r\nEkaterina folds her arms, shutting him up. “Sir, had it not been for Mr. Zhongli, you would have been apprehended by the millelith and blamed for the murders.”\r\n\r\nZhongli steps forward, nodding once at the receptionist. “Ningguang still wishes to speak with him tomorrow, but I shall accompany him for that too.”\r\n\r\nEkaterina sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose. \r\n\r\n“Hey, I caught the culprit though, didn\'t I?” Childe offers, throwing his arms up. \r\n\r\nGranted, he was almost arrested for it instead of the bastard. Fortunately, Zhongli is the best fake boyfriend ever, and also very respected among the millelith. He was able to quickly calm the situation down and explain everything to the guards. Childe almost kissed him on the spot. \r\n\r\nEkaterina relaxes into a small smile. “Yes, we have identified him as a former Fatui member who suddenly left without alerting anyone. It is an oversight on our part; we should have noticed the disappearance sooner… It’s a good coincidence that we decided to change the vault\'s codes or else he would have continued to steal from us.”\r\n\r\nIt was as they predicted. Maksim was stealing money from under their noses to indulge himself in the Galley; once they changed the codes, he resorted to other methods. Xi Shi had been the Galley’s most popular escort at the time, but she was also known to immediately tell the guards if a patron failed to pay the full amount. In the past, many wanted to bed her. Many tried, and later disappeared off the face of the world when they failed to pay up. \r\n\r\nMaksim avoided that same fate by killing her on the spot. He had managed to tamper with the records to make it seem as if he had never seen Xi Shi, but Childe suspects her maid was unlucky enough to see him leave the ship when she came to clean their room. \r\n\r\nWhen questioned about why he had murdered the maid as well, Maksim revealed that she had stupidly tried to confront him about his involvement in Xi Shi’s death. The poor girl had only been trying to help, but her eagerness in solving the case made her a victim as well.\r\n\r\nChilde shakes his head. To think this all happened because one man wanted to have sex that much. Damn. “Can’t believe he’d do all that just to stay in the Galley.”\r\n\r\nZhongli slowly nods. “The Pearl Galley has a tendency to ruin people. I have seen far too many lose themselves to that place.”\r\n\r\nChilde smirks. “You go there.”\r\n\r\n“Only when it is necessary.” Zhongli folds his arms, meeting his smirk with a smile of his own. “Besides, I would much rather spend my time with you.”\r\n\r\nKnowing full well his cheeks are reddening this very second, Childe immediately looks away. “Flatterer.”\r\n\r\nHe hears Ekaterina let out one of her rare laughs. When he looks up, she’s beaming at both of them. “Sir, by the way… I have not yet congratulated you on your engagement.”\r\n\r\nAh, shit. “W-Where did you hear that from…?”\r\n\r\nEkaterina giggles. “Oh, you must be aware by now that Fatui recruits gossip quite a lot.”\r\n\r\nNow that she mentions it, Childe is suddenly aware of all the Fatui eyes trained on them around the bank. He sees a few recruits muttering to each other, staring between him and Zhongli. In the distance, he hears a wolf whistle that immediately dies away the second his head snaps in their direction. \r\n\r\nWhat started out as a small plan to convince his parents that he and Zhongli were together has now somehow ended convincing everyone. Not only that, even he’s starting to get too attached to the idea of being with the consultant. \r\n\r\nChilde groans. He doesn’t know how else to respond to the joy clearly written all over Ekaterina’s face so all he does is fake one of his usual smiles before leaving the bank.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter all of the events from tonight, Childe is drained out. The walk back to the funeral parlour is quiet. He’s lost track of the time, though the empty streets and dead silence in the air tells him it must be past midnight. The shops are long closed by now and the only people left in the streets are him and Zhongli. \r\n\r\nSo much happened tonight that Childe simply ran along with it and didn’t stop to think. Not that he’s known for doing that often, but… \r\n\r\nNow that he does have time to stop and think, all he can remember is Zhongli. He’s looping every memory back in his head, trying to remember what Zhongli felt pressed against him, what he sounded like, how he tasted. \r\n\r\nChilde doubts he can ever forget any of it. He’s gone too far this time. Even as he tries to remind himself about the damn contract, he finds that it doesn’t matter, at least not now. He’ll worry about the contract when these two weeks are over but right now, all he can think about is wanting to kiss Zhongli again. \r\n\r\n“That was quite an eventful night.”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s voice drags him away from his thoughts. Childe glances up, only noticing that they have finally reached the funeral parlour. Zhongli stands outside the door, staring at him as moonlight illuminates the golden tips of his hair. \r\n\r\n“Yeah… Thanks for, uh, coming with me,” Childe says.  “And also for all the help. And for stopping the millelith from arresting me.”\r\n\r\nZhongli smiles. “A pleasure.”\r\n\r\nSilence falls between them. Childe recognises this as the moment he should probably bid goodnight and make his way back to his own apartment. Maybe, if he’s determined enough, he can forget what happened tonight and earn back his sanity by tomorrow. Zhongli will understand they only did all of those things to convince everyone in the Galley they’re together. Childe should do the same.\r\n\r\nHe should say goodbye and leave. He should try to gain back as much control as he can to survive this stupid contract. \r\n\r\nChilde stays where he is. He looks at Zhongli, searching the amber depths of his eyes for anything. \r\n\r\nOh, screw it. \r\n\r\nChilde surges forward. The moment Zhongli’s back hits the door, their lips are on each other and everything else no longer matters. He wastes no time in pushing his tongue into Zhongli’s mouth, eager and greedy to taste him again. The cold bite of the midnight breeze rushes past them, but Childe barely feels it over the heat spreading through his entire body. \r\n\r\nHe crushes Zhongli into the door and swallows the gasp that comes out of him. He wants more. This isn’t enough. This is nowhere near enough. He’s a flame in a forest, frenzied and uncontrollable, desperate to devour everything Zhongli has. He wants him. He has never wanted anything more in his life. \r\n\r\n“Childe…” Zhongli pants, wrapping his arms around his neck. \r\n\r\nThey pull away for a second and Childe drinks in the sight of Zhongli’s swollen lips, the haziness of his amber eyes. He doesn’t want to assume anything but he knows lust when he sees it. He can’t be the only one feeling this. \r\n\r\nChilde bumps his nose against Zhongli’s cheek, struggling to catch his breath. \r\n\r\n“Zhongli… Does your offer still stand?”\r\n\r\n“Offer…? What offer?”\r\n\r\nUnable to help himself, Childe captures Zhongli’s lips again. The kiss is slower, gentler; Childe savours each slide and caress, committing it to memory. \r\n\r\n“What you said on that rooftop,” he says, licking Zhongli’s top lip before pressing a kiss to the corner of his mouth. “Your... sexual arrangement.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Friends with benefits?”\r\n\r\nChilde grins. “You remembered.” \r\n\r\nHe ducks down and latches on Zhongli’s neck, sucking at the mark he’d created earlier. \r\n\r\n“Yes...” Zhongli cranes his neck, burying his fingers through Childe’s hair. “You… You wish to change your mind?”\r\n\r\nChilde bites him, hard, and is quickly rewarded by a surprised moan from the god. He presses an apologetic kiss onto the red mark, swirling his tongue over it until Zhongli trembles against him.   \r\n\r\n“Yes. If you want,” Childe says. “If the offer still stands.” \r\n\r\n“The contract…”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know, but—fuck.” Childe sighs. He rests his forehead against Zhongli’s own, closing his eyes. “I want you, Zhongli, I want you so much. You\'re driving me insane.” \r\n\r\nWhen Childe doesn’t get an immediate response, he leans back and opens his eyes to find Zhongli frowning down. \r\n\r\n“This is fine, isn’t it?” Childe asks. “After all this is finished, we’ll just... go back to how we used to be.”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s lips press together. “No feelings or complications.”\r\n\r\nChilde nods. “Yes. I won’t break your contract. I promise.”\r\n\r\nHe wants to reassure Zhongli that no matter what, he’ll stick to their contract. Although he’s no longer the God of Contracts, Childe knows how important these things are for Zhongli. It might destroy him to keep his end of the bargain, but he never breaks a promise. Once Childe is dedicated to something, he sees it through until the end— even if he’s starting to hate himself more and more for getting himself into this mess.\r\n\r\nZhongli is still not looking at him. His jaw is clenched and his arms have loosened around Childe’s neck. There’s something in his eyes that Childe can’t quite make out. Maybe he’s starting to regret his offer at the rooftop. If so, this is the third time Childe’s going to have a sad, unsatisfied boner, but he won\'t force Zhongli to do anything he doesn’t want to do. \r\n\r\n“You don’t have to—”\r\n\r\nHe’s silenced with a kiss. \r\n\r\n“The offer still stands,” Zhongli says against his lips. “Let’s go inside.”', 'set_in_stone.jpg', '2021-04-25 22:59:57.552128', '2021-04-26 10:15:34.979019', '0', '1', 'set_in_stone_04', '1', '2', 'Set in Stone');
INSERT INTO `sueed_article` VALUES ('5', 'Set in Stone 05', 'The Same with 01', 'Chapter 5: Delusion\r\n\r\nConsidering Childe has known Zhongli for well over a year, it only occurs to him now that he has never thought much about where he lived. He knew he lived in the funeral parlour, and somehow the thought of Zhongli having a room near all of those corpses seemed completely normal. Just your average occurrence for a six thousand year old god, really. \r\n\r\nAs it turns out, there’s a set of apartments above the parlour where many of the staff reside. How Zhongli manages to pay rent for it, Childe has no clue. \r\n\r\nThe moment Childe steps inside, he realises two things straight away: \r\n\r\nZhongli is a hoarder. \r\nChilde is solely funding this hoarding habit.\r\nCalling it an apartment would be inaccurate; a ‘museum’ would be a better description for this place. Everywhere he looks, Childe sees various items and ornaments Zhongli has bought—or more specifically, items and ornaments Childe bought for him. Despite the amount, the place is by no means cluttered; everything is organized and neatly laid out as if Zhongli’s apartment is an exhibition and not a place to sleep in. \r\n\r\nCome to think of it, does Zhongli even need sleep? Childe has never thought about the biological needs of adepti.\r\n\r\nChilde copies Zhongli in slipping off his shoes by the entrance, then follows him into the bedroom; so enamoured by inspecting his surroundings that he almost forgets he’s here to get laid. \r\n\r\nHe’s not even surprised to find there’s more inside Zhongli’s room. Childe lets out a laugh under his breath. \r\n\r\nZhongli turns to face him. “Is something funny?”\r\n\r\nShaking his head, Childe motions towards the room. “It never occurred to me just how much stuff I buy for you…”\r\n\r\nA smile appears on Zhongli’s lips. “You are very generous when it comes to your Mora.”\r\n\r\n“Who else is supposed to fund your hoarding habit? You’re lucky I can afford everything.”\r\n\r\n“If it is becoming a problem for you…”\r\n\r\nChilde laughs again. The small frown on Zhongli’s face is endearingly serious that Childe can’t help tugging at his wrist, pulling him closer.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean it like that. I like buying you things,” Childe reassures. \r\n\r\nHe watches as Zhongli’s frown goes away, replaced by the slight widening of his amber eyes as he notices how close they are. Likewise, Childe can only stare back at him. He’s suddenly reminded of why he’s here in the first place and the realisation leaves him frozen on the spot. \r\n\r\nHe’s going to regret this once this is all over. Zhongli is nothing but a distraction and Childe has no time for distractions, not when he’s pledged his entire life to serving the Tsaritsa.\r\n\r\nYet, as he stares into Zhongli’s eyes, Childe can only think of one god, and it’s not the Tsaritsa. \r\n\r\nHe leans closer, brushing his lips against Zhongli’s before pressing in for a kiss. Zhongli reciprocates with a soft sigh, and the slide of their mouths against each other is just as gentle, just as tender.\r\n\r\nEven as Zhongli overrides all of his senses, Childe still can’t believe he’s here kissing him. He’s imagined this far more than he should have; late at night as he stares up into his ceiling, wondering what Zhongli would taste like, how he’d sound…  None of his expectations come close to reality. He’d thought that an adeptus like Zhongli could be touch-starved, and kissing him would feel like a power surge through Childe’s veins. He entertained the idea of being the only one who would be able to see the god so vulnerable underneath him. \r\n\r\nNo matter what he imagined, Childe didn’t delve into details; he didn’t think that Zhongli’s bottom lip would be plumper than his top. Childe sucks it into his mouth and slips his tongue inside when he hears the other man hum in approval, just as deliciously receptive as Childe hoped he’d be.\r\n\r\nHe runs his tongue along the grooves of Zhongli’s teeth, over the roof of his mouth, around his tongue, everywhere. Half of him wants to throw Zhongli onto the bed and sink into him as soon as he can, while the other half wants to take his time, worshipping him like the god he is. \r\n\r\nThe latter half wins. Childe kisses Zhongli until he’s all he tastes, swallowing every sound that escapes him. He trails his hand up Zhongli’s spine and stops at the nape of his neck, tugging off the tie that secures his ponytail. \r\n\r\nChilde pulls away, sparing a second to admire Zhongli with loose hair. The Archon says nothing, his expression as still as stone; if it weren’t for his swollen lips or the rapid rise and fall of his chest, Childe would think he’s unfazed. \r\n\r\nNo, Zhongli stares back and waits for him. The silent indication that Childe is supposed to take the lead makes him nervous and high off power at the same time. \r\n\r\nHe gulps and steps forward, keeping his eyes fixed on Zhongli as he slowly pushes him towards the bed. Once Zhongli’s back sinks down on the blankets, Childe crawls over him.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever slept with someone before?” he asks, staring down at the image Zhongli makes. \r\n\r\nGods, he must have done something good in his past life to be able to witness something like this. Zhongli is a sight for sore eyes underneath him with his dark hair laying around in inky waves. Childe doesn’t know how he’s going to be able to survive tonight.\r\n\r\nZhongli nods. “Yes, although it has been… a while since then.”\r\n\r\nChilde never expected Zhongli to be a virgin, although the revelation that he’s had sex before also shocks him. The first thought that crosses him is Guizhong. He has to stamp down the ugly surge of jealousy that threatens to ruin his mood.\r\n\r\nAs if sensing his surprise, Zhongli sits up slightly. “It was during my incognito excursions into the mortal realm,” he explains. “I partook in some endeavours to sate my curiosity on human intimacy.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t mention her, Childe thinks. Maybe… \r\n\r\nHe grits his teeth together and shoves aside that train of thought. He doesn’t want to think about that, not now. \r\n\r\nChilde strokes Zhongli’s cheek, gently pushing him back down on the bed. “And how did you find that…?”\r\n\r\nA small frown flutters across Zhongli’s face. “Sex was of little significance to me. It was simply a physical contract between those participating in it.”\r\n\r\nThat definitely sounds like an answer coming from Zhongli, and it couldn’t have made Childe any happier. \r\n\r\nHe smirks. “Sex is more than that, xiansheng… It’s supposed to make you feel good.”\r\n\r\nAs if to make his point, he spreads Zhongli’s legs and slots himself between them before ducking down to kiss his neck, alternating between sucking and biting the existing marks to make sure they’ll stay there for days. He does this until Zhongli is squirming and the quiet breaths he takes become louder, like little gasps he tries to hide. \r\n\r\nChilde leans back, deliberately watching Zhongli’s face as he grinds against him. He’s already painfully hard and he knows Zhongli can feel this by the way he immediately stiffens, his golden eyes widening. Childe grabs hold of his legs and spreads them wider, bucking into Zhongli again and again. It’s nothing but torture when all he wants is to fuck Zhongli, but watching the rapid changes on his face is enough for Childe to hold back. For now. \r\n\r\n“Don’t I make you feel good?” he asks, still watching the god’s face. Zhongli’s eyes are squeezed shut and every time Childe grinds into him, he lets out a gasp that gives him the same satisfaction as winning a battle would. He can get addicted to this. \r\n\r\n“Yes,” Zhongli pants. “Yes, you do.”\r\n\r\nSmiling, Childe kisses him. “We’ve barely begun,” he says, biting Zhongli’s bottom lip. “I can make you feel even better.”\r\n\r\nZhongli shudders, tilting his head up to chase Childe’s lips. They kiss for a while as Childe continues rolling his hips forward, groaning at the feel of his dick rubbing against his clothes. It feels amazing, but if he doesn’t get his dick inside this man any time soon, Childe is going to combust. \r\n\r\nFuck, no, there’s too many clothes between them. He needs to hurry this along. \r\n\r\nChilde breaks the kiss, struggling to catch his breath. “Do you have any oil?”\r\n\r\nDazed, Zhongli blinks several times. “Oil…? Oh. On the dresser… There is lotus oil.”\r\n\r\nChilde winks at him. “I’ll be back.”\r\n\r\nHe almost trips over rushing across the room. As Zhongli said, there’s a vial of lotus oil on the dresser, along with various hair ornaments and a small pot of rouge that Childe suspects is what he uses for his makeup. He quickly grabs the lotus oil and all but runs back to the bed. \r\n\r\n“I’m back,” he says.\r\n\r\nWrapping his arms around his neck, Zhongli gives him a smile that pauses all mental capacity in his brain. “Welcome back.”\r\n\r\nShit, Childe thinks as his heart flips over. He’s really not going to survive tonight. \r\n\r\nImpatient, he unfastens the buttons of Zhongli’s changshan and slides it off. To no one’s surprise, Zhongli is wearing another layer underneath—because of course this man has to be covered at all costs to remind Childe that the most he’s ever seen from him is a sliver of his ankle. Childe wastes no time in pulling Zhongli’s other shirt off as well, sucking in a breath once he’s rewarded with bare skin. \r\n\r\nArchons… Childe is stepping onto sacrilege territory with the way his dick twitches at the sight of Zhongli exposed underneath him. Aside from the hickeys Childe has left all over his neck, there’s not a single blemish on his skin. It only makes him want to cover Zhongli’s entire body with more, lay claim to the god like the greedy mortal he’s fast realising he is. \r\n\r\nHe does just that; ducking down to suck one of Zhongli’s nipples. Almost immediately, Zhongli jerks back, clearly not expecting this, and Childe strokes his arm in an attempt to reassure him, all the while swirling his tongue around the soft skin. When he feels it hardening in his mouth, he can’t stop himself from clamping the nub between his teeth.\r\n\r\nZhongli hisses, grabbing onto his head. Childe sucks on the nipple one more time before switching to the other one. He gives this one the same treatment, all too aware of how much Zhongli is now gripping his hair, wrapping his legs around Childe’s waist in an attempt to pull him closer. \r\n\r\nChilde pays him no mind. He kisses up Zhongli’s chest; with each new mark he leaves on his skin, victory surges in his veins. These marks may be as temporary as their contract, but he can delude himself into thinking this is enough. He bites at Zhongli’s collarbone, not enough for it to draw blood, but enough for him to cry out in pain. Childe quickly sucks the spot, licking over the indents his teeth left behind. \r\n\r\nZhongli pulls his hair tighter. “You are very… slow.”\r\n\r\nChilde can’t help but laugh at that. Finally, he leans back, satisfied with the collection of marks he’s left all over Zhongli’s body.\r\n\r\n“The almighty Rex Lapis, known for his unwavering patience and composure, wants me to hurry up.”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s eyes narrow. “Childe.”\r\n\r\nIf Zhongli wants him to hurry up, then who is he to deny that request? Childe hooks his fingers under Zhongli’s pants and tugs them off along with his underclothes. He throws the clothes to the far corner of the room and sucks in a breath once he sees the sight waiting for him. \r\n\r\nChilde has had his fair share of casual partners; men, women, it doesn’t matter to him—but he’s never come across anyone as breathtaking as Zhongli. He wonders how many people have been lucky enough to see Zhongli like this; bare, vulnerable, waiting for them to make the first move. Even his dick makes a pretty sight; tinged pink and already leaking from the tip, begging to be touched. \r\n\r\nHe thinks back to what the Archon said earlier, about how he only saw sex as another one of his contracts. Childe wants to believe he’s the only one who can bring forth a reaction out of Zhongli, the only one who can fuck the god so good that he’ll want more.\r\n\r\n“Celestia, you’re beautiful,” he says, drinking everything in. \r\n\r\nZhongli tugs at his collar. “Childe… I wish to see you too.”\r\n\r\nChilde shrugs his changshan off in less than a second, chucking it to the back of the room. He stays still, completely aware of those golden eyes scanning him, hovering over all the various scars that map different stories across his body. Not once in his life has he felt self conscious about them; in fact, he takes pride in every scar he receives. \r\n\r\nHe wonders if it pleases Zhongli; if the sight of him is attractive in his eyes. It surprises him that this means a lot; he wants to be desirable for the god, just as how Zhongli has plagued his every thought and refuses to let him go. \r\n\r\nZhongli leans forward, running his hands up Childe’s chest. \r\n\r\n“You have plenty of scars…” he says, and then squeezes one of Childe’s biceps, frowning. “Are these burns?”\r\n\r\nHe strokes down Childe’s right arm, following the scarred trail that runs like jagged branches of burnt skin. The burns spread along Childe’s arms and down his back, joined by other scars he’d received from different battles in the past. \r\n\r\nZhongli’s touch is gentle, too gentle, as if he fears it’ll hurt. \r\n\r\n“It doesn’t hurt,” Childe reassures. “It just comes from using my delusion too much.”\r\n\r\nThe frown on Zhongli’s face remains. His eyes meet Childe’s for a moment before he presses his lips onto a scar on his chest. It’s one of his deeper scars; a large gash narrowly missing his heart, a permanent reminder of a battle he still looks back on with pride. \r\n\r\n“How did you get this?” Zhongli asks, lips fluttering across the edge of the gash.\r\n\r\nChilde licks his lips, unable to think when Zhongli is covering his chest with tender kisses that sends his stomach flipping with every touch. “Um, I was fifteen. I took on ten Fatui skirmishers by myself.”\r\n\r\n“Ten?”\r\n\r\nChilde nods, careful not to move too much as Zhongli continues the exploration of his body. Zhongli’s lips have now moved onto his shoulder, mapping the burns with his tongue.\r\n\r\n“I was young and bored,” Childe says. \r\n\r\n“And very reckless.”\r\n\r\n“I still am.”\r\n\r\n“I am aware,” Zhongli huffs. \r\n\r\nThe laughter Childe was going to let out dies the moment Zhongli kisses the spot just above his heart. He freezes. His pulse thunders in his ears and he can feel his face heating up with the rest of his body. He’d been so caught up worshipping Zhongli earlier that it didn\'t occur to Childe he’d never had the same happen for him. \r\n\r\nShit. This won’t do. He can’t get caught up in feelings now. \r\n\r\nHe forces out a laugh and grabs Zhongli’s shoulders, yanking him up. “Look who’s being too slow now.”\r\n\r\nZhongli settles back down on the bed. “I am admiring you. You are very pleasing to look at.”\r\n\r\n“I can say the same for you,” Childe retorts as he sits back and grabs the vial of lotus oil.\r\n\r\nHe needs to hurry this along and get his dick inside Zhongli before his brain starts conjuring up more complicated thoughts and feelings. \r\n\r\nChilde grabs Zhongli’s thighs and pries them open, bending the right one higher so he’s given a perfect view of him. From the corner of his eyes, he can see Zhongli turning his face away, probably embarrassed, but he keeps his legs apart and makes no attempts to resist. \r\n\r\n“Keep your legs like that,” Childe commands, letting go. He stays still for a moment, thoroughly satisfied when Zhongli does as he says. “I’m going to start touching you now, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\nKeeping his eyes on the tight pucker of Zhongli’s hole, he coats his fingers with lotus oil. The power is already starting to get to his head. Just having Zhongli listening to his every word and exposing himself like this is making Childe’s dick harder than ever. He has never been so turned on in his entire life. This man is going to be the death of him. \r\n\r\nUnable to wait any longer, he rubs his finger along the rim of Zhongli’s hole, coating it with oil. Zhongli jumps as the cold liquid drips down his ass. He’s so sensitive to everything that Childe can already imagine his reactions once he starts fucking him. \r\n\r\nHe pushes down on Zhongli’s raised leg, spreading him even more. At the same time, Childe dips a finger inside, slowly, gritting his teeth at the warmth that immediately tightens around him. \r\n\r\n“Fuck, you\'re tight,” he says, twisting his finger inside until it’s knuckle deep. The fleshy walls squeeze him in, so sensitive; he’s already imagining how good it’ll feel to have his cock inside this. Childe keeps it there for a moment, glancing up to see how Zhongli is reacting. \r\n\r\nThe god has his eyes squeezed shut as he bites his lip, muffling any sound that escapes him. Of course, that only poses a challenge for Childe; a challenge he’s very keen on beating. \r\n\r\nHolding back his smile, he prods around the hole, massaging the heated walls until he finds the spot he’s looking for.  \r\n\r\nZhongli jerks forward. “Nnngh!” \r\n\r\nAs if he has all the time in the world, Childe slowly drags his finger out and strokes around the puckered entrance, spreading more oil. He dips the digit back inside, only the tip, admiring the way the tight hole tries to swallow him in. Zhongli keens under him, hips bucking forward. So desperate for more.\r\n\r\nHe repeats his motions, dipping his finger inside but dragging it out before it satisfies Zhongli. He can tell by the way Zhongli’s legs are trembling that he’s starting to get impatient. \r\n\r\nChilde grins. He pulls his finger out and plunges two back inside, twisting them straight into Zhongli’s prostate. As expected, Zhongli responds with a cry, his legs squeezing together. Childe pries them apart and thrusts back into the same spot. \r\n\r\n“You like that?” he asks, although he doubts Zhongli can focus on his voice, not when he’s plunging his fingers again and again into his prostate. \r\n\r\nChilde takes pleasure in watching his fingers disappear into the tight hole. He imagines how loose and pliant he can turn it once he’s finished fucking Zhongli all night, how much he’d like to see it dripping with his cum. Zhongli would look so good fucked out on the bed, delirious with pleasure and fatigue. He wants to witness it. He wants to be the only one who’s ever made him feel good, the only one whose name he moans out. He wants to Zhongli to forget about all the irrelevant people he’s slept with in the past and only remember him, only him, no one else—no one else can make him feel this good, only Childe, only Childe—\r\n\r\nSo lost in his thoughts that he hadn’t noticed how much Zhongli is now thrashing underneath him, whining and gasping. To his credit, he’s managed to keep his legs spread out, but one of his hands is now clamped around his mouth, desperately trying to silence himself. \r\n\r\n“I want to hear you,” Childe says, prying Zhongli’s hand away from his face. He pins it above his head and shoves a third finger inside, pistoning all three in and out, in and out, until Zhongli’s voice comes out in choked moans. He’s no longer as tight as before; Childe’s fingers easily slide in, squelching from the lube he’s generously poured all over Zhongli’s hole.\r\n\r\nZhongli lurches up. “Childe! Ah, ah—Childe!” \r\n\r\nUsing his weight, he pushes Zhongli back down on the bed, keeping him in place. He fucks him faster with his fingers, driving into the same spot again and again and again. Zhongli shakes like a leaf beneath him—and Gods, the sounds he\'s making are addicting. \r\n\r\n“That\'s a good boy. You\'re loosening up just for me,” Childe says into Zhongli\'s ear. \r\n\r\nWhen he glances up to see his face, he only notices now that there\'s a faint glow around them. Golden light bounces onto the sheets, reflecting from the locks of hair that fan under Zhongli. Every time he thrusts inside, these golden tips pulse brighter, only ever so slightly, but enough for Childe to be reminded that Zhongli is not human. Not even close.\r\n\r\nChilde has never seen anything so beautiful. \r\n\r\nHe lifts Zhongli\'s hips off the bed and uses the leverage to ram his fingers in deeper, harder. His arm is beginning to hurt but he doesn’t stop the abuse on his prostate, curious to see if he can make Zhongli come like this. By the looks of it, he’s close. Very close. \r\n\r\nZhongli’s back arches off the bed and he’s shaking so much that Childe has to push down on his shoulders to keep him still. Again.\r\n\r\n“Childe—please,” Zhongli whines, gripping onto the bed sheets. The gradients of his hair are bright gold now, illuminating the dim room. “I’m… I’m—ah! O-Oh—!”\r\n\r\nZhongli throws his head back; broken sobs choking out of him, toes curled, his hole squeezing around Childe’s fingers. As soon as Childe sees his body quivering, he grabs Zhongli’s cock and strokes it, listening to the sounds of his moans get louder and louder until, finally—finally, white ropes of cum spurt out of him. He massages Zhongli’s prostate and strokes him through his orgasm, unable to take his eyes off the pretty image the god makes when he’s coming. \r\n\r\nHis body creates a beautiful arch as he loses himself in his pleasure, twitching and gasping, eyes half-lidded and completely fucked out when they’ve barely even begun. Tempted, Childe leans over and licks up the hard planes of Zhongli’s abdomen, tasting the cum splattered all over him.\r\n\r\nFuck. He’s so fucking hard. He can’t wait any longer. \r\n\r\nChilde pulls away from Zhongli and tugs off his pants in record timing. He sighs in relief as soon as his dick is free from the confines of his clothes, and gives it a few strokes to coat it in oil. Still trembling from his orgasm, Zhongli looks up, gaze stopping at Childe’s dick. \r\n\r\nCompletely aware that he’s being watched, Childe gives himself a few more strokes, pressing a thumb against the engorged head of his cock. He hisses. It’s so painfully tempting to jerk off until he comes all over Zhongli. Imagining the god covered in splatters of his cum is enough to almost send Childe over the edge. \r\n\r\nArchons, was he always this depraved before? \r\n\r\n“What are you thinking?” he asks, shuffling closer. \r\n\r\n“You are very large,” Zhongli comments. \r\n\r\nChilde barks out a laugh. “Thanks for the ego boost. Got any more comments?”\r\n\r\n“I expected you to be averagely-sized.”\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t actually serious when he asked for an elaboration, but of course Zhongli is a gift that keeps on giving. “Oh, you’ve seen your fair share of dicks to know the average size, xiansheng?”\r\n\r\n“I was not insinuating that,” Zhongli says. He touches a finger to his lips and his eyes drift off into that far-away look he has when he loses himself in his thoughts. “But I have heard mortals say that the average size of a human’s penis, when fully erect, is approximately—”\r\n\r\nOkay, this conversation is dangerously tipping out of control. Childe shuts Zhongli up with a kiss before he launches off into an hour long lecture about the anatomy of dicks. The kiss works wonders and it’s not long until Zhongli relaxes back into him, all talk of dicks and sizes long forgotten. \r\n\r\nPulling away, Childe grabs Zhongli’s legs and spreads them out again, admiring the oil drenched hole waiting for him. “Think you can go again?” \r\n\r\nThankfully, Zhongli nods. Childe isn’t sure how his dick would survive if Zhongli denied him now. \r\n\r\n“I would like to…” Zhongli says. “I want to… feel you inside me.”\r\n\r\nThat’s enough affirmation for Childe. He lines his dick to Zhongli’s entrance, rubbing the head of it around the twitching rim. Before he inches inside, he looks up and meets Zhongli’s gaze; the golden depths of his eyes are so deep, it’s impossible to fathom what in the world the god is thinking, or how they ended up in this predicament. One week ago, Childe wouldn’t have dared to even imagine touching the god in this way but now he can’t think of anything he wants more. He’s never wanted anyone so much in his life. \r\n\r\nWith that thought, Childe slides himself in.\r\n\r\nInstantly, he’s squeezed by tight, wet warmth that almost tempts him to snap his hips forward and take Zhongli all in one go. Childe resists it, fisting his hands into the blanket as he pushes more and more of his length inside. \r\n\r\n“Fuck,” he hisses. \r\n\r\nGasping, Zhongli arches into him. The strands of his hair begin to glow gold once again. \r\n\r\nChilde groans and gradually sinks the rest of his cock inside until he’s balls deep. For a second, he stays in place, overwhelmed by the heat, the sensations of Zhongli squeezing around him. Zhongli is so tight, so fucking good. \r\n\r\nHe looks up to find Zhongli’s red eyeliner is smudged and his bangs are damp with sweat. Tears bead at the corner of his eyes and his lips are swollen from how much he bites them, trying in vain to contain his moans. So, so beautiful. \r\n\r\n“Oh…” Zhongli gasps. “Oh.”\r\n\r\nChilde feels his self control shatter into pieces. He grips Zhongli’s waist, pulls out, then thrusts back in. Zhongli cries, shaking, and in the back of Childe’s mind, he remembers that Zhongli just came and he must be sensitive—but he can\'t stop himself. He pulls Zhongli down on his dick and fucks him fast, clumsy thrusts into his wet hole to chase that delicious friction. \r\n\r\n“Ah! Ah… Ah!” Zhongli’s voice pierces through his lust-hazed mind. Childe grips the god’s dick and strokes it, ripping weak moans out of him. “O-Oh… Ohhhh. Ajax… Ajax…”\r\n\r\nHe can’t think. All he sees is Zhongli underneath him, taking his cock so well. He’s never seen anything so good, felt anything so good. \r\n\r\nOldest Archon in history, revered and worshipped by thousands and thousands of his people, and he’s now impaled on Childe’s dick while moaning out his name. Childe loves it all a bit too much. He pounds into the tight heat, listening to his thighs slap against Zhongli’s ass. \r\n\r\nAlready hard for the second time, Zhongli’s dick bounces with each thrust. Childe wonders how many times he can make him come tonight. He’s already addicted to this feeling. He doesn’t ever want to stop; he wants to fuck Zhongli until the sun rises, until the god memorises the feel of his cock shaping his insides even when he’s no longer there. \r\n\r\n“You feel amazing,” he says. “Fuck.”\r\n\r\nZhongli bucks up into him, clumsily meeting his thrusts. “P-Please… Please…”\r\n\r\nChilde shoves him back down on his cock, grinding into his prostate until Zhongli’s words trail off into a garble. \r\n\r\n“What do you want?” he asks, reaching forward to push Zhongli’s bangs away from his eyes. “Tell me what you need.”\r\n\r\n“Harder,” Zhongli chokes out. “I need you… to go harder.”\r\n\r\nThat’s the best thing Zhongli could have said. Childe pulls out, ignoring the confused noise coming from below him, then grabs Zhongli’s legs and lifts them onto his shoulders. \r\n\r\n“Childe, what—ah!”\r\n\r\nChilde rams back inside Zhongli, using the leverage to reach as deep as he can. He gives the other man no time to adjust, pounding back into the same spot with enough force to knock the bedframe into the wall. Zhongli convulses, hips bucking off the bed as Childe slams into his prostate again, again, again, almost bending his body in half. \r\n\r\n“Oh, oh, oh! Nngh! Childe—ah!”\r\n\r\n“Ajax,” Childe grits out, digging his fingers into Zhongli’s slender waist. “I like it when you call me that.”\r\n\r\nDesperately, Zhongli nods. His red eyeliner has now streaked down his cheekbones and there’s drool dripping from the corner of his mouth. He has never looked so good.\r\n\r\n“Ajax…  Ah…” Zhongli licks his lips, clearly struggling for words. “It… It feels…”\r\n\r\n“How does it feel, Zhongli?” Childe asks. He slows down, rolling his hips in shallow thrusts that has them both moaning at the same time. \r\n\r\nZhongli’s eyes roll back. “Ohhh…”\r\n\r\nChilde could listen to him moaning all day. He’s so hot and every sound that escapes him only makes Childe want to fuck him harder, faster. He wants to fuck him so hard that everyone in Liyue hears him. He wants them all to know that Zhongli belongs to him, that even if this relationship is fake then at least this is all real. \r\n\r\n“Come on, Zhongli, tell me. How does it feel to have my cock inside you?” Childe slides out until only the tip of his cock is left, then plunges back inside. “Fucking you deep?”\r\n\r\n“Hng! Ah! Ah..!”\r\n\r\nChilde rams into the spot that sends Zhongli spasming against his body, once, twice. “Tell me how it—feels.” Three times.\r\n\r\nZhongli is shaking so much that Childe reaches down and grips the base of his cock, not quite allowing the god to come again just yet. The whimper Zhongli lets out almost makes him feel sorry for him. Almost. \r\n\r\nBut Childe did always have a sadistic side, and Zhongli is starting to reawaken it. \r\n\r\nPanting, Zhongli’s head lolls to the side as he struggles to catch his breath. “Ah… Amazing... I… I… I c-cannot think. It\'s... t-too much.” He squeezes his eyes shut, causing beads of tears to roll down his cheeks. \r\n\r\nThe thick fog of lust in Childe\'s mind dissipates for a second. With a weak whine, Zhongli\'s legs slip off from his shoulders as he shudders in large gulps of air. As much as it drives him crazy, Childe stops, granting Zhongli some mercy to catch his breath. He lets go of Zhongli\'s dick and presses his lips to his forehead, brushing back sweat dampened locks of hair.\r\n\r\n“You feel so good,\" he says. \"So fucking perfect.”\r\n\r\nZhongli hums as his hair pulses gold. He leans into Childe, allowing him to pepper kisses all over his face. Childe kisses away the tears on his cheek, ignoring the weight clawing at his chest. Deep down, the voice in his head tells him this isn\'t just a casual fuck anymore. He\'s gone too far now. \r\n\r\nHowever, with Zhongli sighing in his arms and keening under his lips, he can\'t bring himself to regret it. Not yet anyway. \r\n\r\nOnce Zhongli calms down, he looks up and nods at him. \"Continue.\" \r\n\r\nEager to please and even more eager to forget the direction of his thoughts, Childe lifts Zhongli\'s legs onto his shoulders like before and plunges back home.\r\n\r\n“O-Oh! There! D-Don\'t stop!”\r\n\r\nChilde wouldn’t be able to stop even if the world was ending. He fucks him as hard and fast and deep as he can, sending the bedframe slamming into the wall with each thrust. Zhongli has had his moment of reprieve and  now Childe focuses on devouring him. The room is filled with the nonstop sounds of skin slapping against skin, the unending banging on the wall, Zhongli’s moans rising louder, louder; music to Childe’s ears.\r\n\r\nWith each second that rushes by, Zhongli squeezes more and more around him. Childe can’t get enough. He tunnels in on one goal and one goal only, and that’s to conquer Zhongli as he would conquer a battle.\r\n\r\nElectricity dances along his veins, crackling at the surface of his skin, mingling with sweat. He barely notices it, barely even knows what’s happening. He’s no longer wearing his vision or delusion—they’re probably still close enough to take effect—but, fuck, it doesn’t matter. Childe uses all of his weight and strength, almost folding Zhongli in half as he batters into his prostate for the hundredth time. \r\n\r\n“Ajax! Oh—oh, A-Ajax! You—you’re—a-ahh!” \r\n\r\nChilde is too far gone to pay attention. His delusion sparks again, electricity escaping from his fingers and clawing at Zhongli’s abdomen. He hears a strangled cry from Zhongli before he clenches impossibly tight around him. As he continues to ram into the addicting heat, warm liquid splatters against his stomach and he gathers that Zhongli must be coming for the second time. Zhongli spasms under him, legs slipping off Childe’s shoulders as his climax robs him of all his strength. Still, Childe slams inside, feeling the heat build up in his gut more, more, more. \r\n\r\nHe lifts Zhongli’s ass off the bed. The god is still trembling, so weak and drained that he can do nothing as Childe manhandles him into any way he sees fit.\r\n\r\nFrom this position, Childe has a good view of Zhongli’s whole body—and what a good view it is. His skin is mapped with bruises, drenched in sweat and cum; red-rimmed eyes streaked with tears and lips slick with drool. The gradients of his hair are once again glowing against the bedsheets, so bright they pulse within the near darkness of the room…\r\n\r\nAs Childe admires Zhongli, he notices something that makes him falter. Parts of Zhongli’s skin begin to darken into the same colour as charcoal, spreading up his arms and around his neck. He quickly grabs one of Zhongli’s arms, surprised to find it’s still as soft as before. Zhongli shudders again. When he releases a breath, sigils light up all over on his body, gold illuminated against stone, glowing brighter than ever. \r\n\r\n“Xian… Xiansheng? What’s happening? Are you okay?” Childe says, searching Zhongli’s face for any signs of pain. “Did I do something wrong?”\r\n\r\nWeakly, Zhongli shakes his head, throwing an arm over his face in an attempt to hide it.\r\n\r\n“I’m… I am fine… It is… It…” He continues to shake. The golden sigils on his body pulse along to the laboured breaths he lets out. “You are overwhelming me too much. I am… ah, losing control over my current form…”\r\n\r\nChilde has to take a second for that to sink in. He’s quite literally fucking Zhongli out of his mortal form.\r\n\r\nAs if Childe didn’t need a reminder that he’s fucking a literal god. \r\n\r\n“Fuck,” he says, ramming back into Zhongli’s hole. “You drive me—insane. Fuck.”\r\n\r\nZhongli screams out something—Childe’s name, probably—but he barely hears it over the thundering pulse in his ears as he pounds his cock in and out of the pliant hole. His thrusts become clumsy, frenzied, and he grunts into Zhongli’s ear as the heat builds deep in his gut, so, so close.\r\n\r\n“Ah—Ajax!  Ajax!” \r\n\r\nChilde pins Zhongli down, feeling the heat of skin against skin. Zhongli burns to the touch but it’s not enough, still not enough; Childe chases after his own orgasm, fucking into Zhongli as fast as he can, relishing each drag of his walls around his dick. \r\n\r\n“I want you—all to myself,” he groans, not knowing what he’s saying anymore. All he knows is that he never wants this to end, he wants to fuck Zhongli forever, he wants to keep him. “Fuck, Zhongli!”\r\n\r\nZhongli grabs his face with trembling hands, his eyes wild, pupils blown. “Kiss… Kiss me!”\r\n\r\nChilde lunges forward and captures his lips. They clumsily meet each other in a mess of tongue and teeth; the kiss is hardly a kiss at all and more of Childe gasping into Zhongli’s mouth as his thrusts become erratic. He’s close. \r\n\r\nHe pulls away, resting his forehead against Zhongli’s, staring at him in the eyes. Sweat drips down his temples, his thighs burn, and his dick is begging for release—so, so fucking close. \r\n\r\n“Has anyone ever made you feel this good?” he asks, suddenly in need of the answer. \r\n\r\nZhongli shakes his head. “No… No… Only you…” He takes another deep breath and tilts his head up, brushing his lips against Childe’s. “No one… No one has ever made me feel like this…”\r\n\r\nThat’s all it takes to send him over the edge. Childe slams back into Zhongli—and blinding, white-hot pleasure overtakes him, causing the world to ripple for a second. He spills inside the tight warmth, groaning as he rolls his hips back and forth; the drag and pull of Zhongli’s twitching walls around his sensitive dick so good, so good. \r\n\r\nUnderneath him, Zhongli can only moan weakly, clutching his stomach while Childe continues to ride out the rest of his orgasm. Zhongli violently shakes, and his dick makes a pathetic attempt of dribbling out translucent liquid as he comes for the last time, utterly spent and drained. \r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t know how long he spends emptying himself inside Zhongli, making sure to milk every last drop, suddenly obsessed with the idea of desecrating the god more than he already has. When it’s over, he can’t bring himself to pull out just yet. His arms give out and he topples forward, hearing a soft grunt from below as he tangles with Zhongli’s limbs.\r\n\r\nThey stay like that for a while, listening to the sounds of their laboured breathing, the raging stampede of Childe’s pulse. He buries his face into Zhongli’s neck and breathes in, out, drowning in the scent of sex and sweat. \r\n\r\nAfter what feels like an eternity, Childe gathers the strength to heft himself up, pulling out of Zhongli. He catches sight of his cum oozing out of the swollen hole and has to stamp down the ridiculous urge to go again straight away. Fucking hell, his brain has truly regressed back into a hormone-induced adolescent who has just discovered the wonders of jerking off for the first time. \r\n\r\nWith his limbs feeling like jelly, Childe rolls to the side and glances at his partner, checking to see if he’s alive. Now that he’s no longer in the heat of the moment, he can fully appreciate how wrecked Zhongli looks. Childe can\'t recognise him as the prim and proper consultant, usually covered in several layers clothes; the epitome of dignity and grace. Right now, Zhongli is… Zhongli is perfect. He always has been, but Childe can’t stop looking at him like this.\r\n\r\nHe tucks a sweat-soaked strand of hair behind Zhongli’s ear, brushing his bangs away from his eyes. Still catching his breath, Zhongli spares him a tired smile. \r\n\r\n“Are you… Are you okay?” Childe asks. “Sorry, I—I got carried away.” \r\n\r\nZhongli turns to face him. Childe doesn’t miss the way he winces slightly when he moves his thighs. \r\n\r\n“No… It is fine,” he says, voice husky. “That was… That was wonderful.”\r\n\r\nGeo sigils continue to glow up his arms like golden veins. They pulse weakly now, as if the light is dying, but it’s enough to illuminate the small area between them, encasing the outlines of Zhongli’s jaw in amber. Mesmerised, Childe gently takes one of Zhongli’s hands into his own, tracing the golden marks with his finger. \r\n\r\n“You’re so beautiful,” Childe says, looking up to meet Zhongli’s gaze. \r\n\r\nThe god’s eyes soften. “It does not scare you?”\r\n\r\n“No, should it?”\r\n\r\nZhongli tilts his head. “Many mortals would be intimidated if someone they knew suddenly changed their physical form.”\r\n\r\nChilde chuckles at that. Come to think of it, Zhongli has never seen his Foul Legacy form… He’s not the only one who can change forms after all. \r\n\r\n“Maybe,” he says. “But you forget who you’re talking to. I’m not one to scare easily, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\nA soft laugh rolls out of Zhongli’s lips. “I am glad you do not mind.”\r\n\r\n“Of course I don’t. Besides…” Smirking, Childe slides his hands down Zhongli’s waist and hauls him closer, gripping the plump curve of his ass. Gods, he’s waited so long to finally be able to grab this thing without it bordering on sexual harassment. “I like that I fucked you so good that you lost control of your form.”\r\n\r\nHe’s thankful for the golden light between them; it gives him the opportunity to see the blush spreading across Zhongli’s cheeks. \r\n\r\n“I would like for us to do this again…” Zhongli utters. \r\n\r\nChilde grins. “I’m not against that.”\r\n\r\n“Until the contract ends, of course.”\r\n\r\nHe blinks. Way to kill the mood, Zhongli. Childe’s smile falters and he nods once, watching as Zhongli’s gaze now averts down. “Right,” he says. “The contract. Of course.”\r\n\r\nSilence. Now that they’re done, should he pull away from Zhongli? He didn’t exactly establish a time frame of how long both of them can fuck, nor did he say whether this can be a recurring thing. Despite the initial agreement of keeping everything casual, Childe knows that casual was the last thing on his mind while he was fucking Zhongli. He gave that his all. He fucked Zhongli as if he belonged to him, as if all of this is real. \r\n\r\nHe sighs, rolling back to face the ceiling instead. Zhongli turns away too, pulling the blankets up to cover both of them. \r\n\r\n“Do you often have sex with others?”\r\n\r\nThe question catches Childe off guard. He stares at Zhongli from the corner of his eyes, folding his arms behind his head. “If I feel like it. I try not to get too involved with people though.” At least not until I met you, anyway. \r\n\r\nZhongli nods. “I see.”\r\n\r\n“...And you?” he asks, directing the question back at him. “I know you said you experimented a few times when you were incognito, but have you never met anyone that made you want to sleep with them?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Zhongli answers, not even stopping to think about it. “Emotions were still very foreign to me, thus I did not feel there was any need for intimacy or physical pleasure. All that mattered to me were my contracts and my people. It was only when I was curious to learn more about humans did I seek to experience sex for myself.”\r\n\r\nThe sensible thing to do would be to leave it at that. Childe, unfortunately, is not sensible. He’s curious and clearly masochistic because all he can think about is one name; one name that continues to fill him with pathetic jealousy at ridiculous times. \r\n\r\n“…What about Guizhong?”\r\n\r\nZhongli stirs beside him. Childe faces him again, noting the surprise in his eyes. \r\n\r\n“What about her?” Zhongli asks, frowning.\r\n\r\n“Was she not important to you? Many say you two were inseparable. I assumed that… that you two…”\r\n\r\n“Guizhong... was very important to me. She still is,” he says, his voice lowering to almost a whisper. “When she was still alive, she wished for me to experience emotions as humans would. She understood their pain, their suffering,  their happiness; everything that made them so interesting to her. I could not.” \r\n\r\nAs he talks, Zhongli’s frown deepens, although his eyes are no longer focusing on Childe. He seems lost in a different time. “I enjoyed her company and being by her side felt natural. We truly were inseparable.”\r\n\r\nChilde swallows the lump stuck in his throat, wishing he never asked about this. \r\n\r\n“But I failed to grasp what she made me feel. After she died, all I knew was that… it was painful. I had fought countless battles, but the pain of losing her hurt more than any injury I sustained during the war. I had never felt anything like it.”\r\n\r\nThe sadness in his voice drags Childe away from his own selfish feelings. He hooks an arm around Zhongli’s shoulders, pulling him into his chest and leans down to kiss his forehead. “You felt grief.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Zhongli says, wrapping his own arms around Childe’s waist. “I understand that now.”\r\n\r\nFrom this position, Childe knows Zhongli can hear the rapid beating of his pulse, giddy and nervous at having him so close, elated at the fact both of them fit into each other’s arms like missing pieces of a puzzle. There’s no one around for them to act like a couple for now, and yet this is their most convincing act so far. Even Childe is starting to believe the delusion himself. \r\n\r\nHe gives up on fighting it. For the duration of their contract, he’ll go along with the act and enjoy it until then. After that… Well, Childe doesn’t want to think about that. \r\n\r\n“I am still struggling to understand the concept of love…” Zhongli says. His voice tickles Childe’s collarbones. “I assumed that if one enjoys being with someone, then that meant they loved them; and from my observations, mortals tend to marry each other if they are in love.”\r\n\r\nThe change in topic is unexpected; moreso the topic of marriage. Childe squints at the darkness, wondering what goes on in Zhongli’s mind for the hundredth time. \r\n\r\n“Uh, I guess… Most people do marry if they love each other.”\r\n\r\nZhongli looks up at him. “You do not wish to marry.”\r\n\r\nChilde breathes out a laugh. “I don\'t think I\'m cut out for that life, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\nFor some reason, Zhongli’s eyes only narrow. He must be quite serious about marriage; perhaps Childe’s casual dismissal about it is offensive… \r\n\r\n“Even if you find someone that you love… will you not marry them?”\r\n\r\nChilde blanches at that question. He hates how he immediately thinks of Zhongli— because while he admits he does have feelings for the god, he doesn’t want to label it as love, not when that’s a concept he’s never considered in his life. Harbingers don’t have time for that. He doesn’t have time for that. Zhongli is a temporary distraction he’ll have to get over at some point. \r\n\r\n“I… It\'s not something I think about a lot,” he admits. “I\'m a Harbinger after all.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm.” Zhongli settles back on his chest. “Is it… because you do not want to marry, or because you do not think you are capable of love that you cannot marry?”\r\n\r\nCelestia, Zhongli is really hung up on this. \r\n\r\n“I don\'t know. Like I said, I\'m a Harbinger. It\'s not like I have time for any of that.”\r\n\r\nLike before, Zhongli hums again, only he sounds far from happy with that answer. It shouldn’t be a surprise; there are people who think marriage is a sacred thing, and Zhongli seems to be the type of person who would take that seriously. \r\n\r\nChilde wonders if Zhongli will eventually find someone to marry in the future. Didn’t he say he wanted to enjoy the rest of his life as a mortal? \r\n\r\nWhen Childe is back in Snezhnaya, losing himself in his duties as a Harbinger, will Zhongli eventually find someone else to replace him with? \r\n\r\nThis train of thought drops an unpleasant weight in his chest. Childe clenches his jaw and forces the image of Zhongli with a family of his own out of his head. \r\n\r\n“Do you have other forms?” Childe suddenly asks, eager to change the topic. “I know you can turn into a dragon…”\r\n\r\nLuckily, Zhongli does not question the conversation veering into a new path. “Yes. I am able to change into many forms, regardless of age, gender, or species. This is the form I feel most comfortable in, for the time being.”\r\n\r\nAll coherent thought is wiped from his brain as he imagines what Zhongli would look like if he changed into a woman. He’s read some books that said Rex Lapis took on various forms across the ages, but he thought they were only exaggerated stories written to compel the audience. \r\n\r\nDamn. \r\n\r\n“I like you the way you are,” Childe blurts out while his traitor of a dick twitches in interest at the thought of what Zhongli would look like as a woman. \r\n\r\n“Thank you,” Zhongli responds. “I believe changing forms is similar to the many facades humans like to have.”\r\n\r\n“What...  do you mean?”\r\n\r\nZhongli lifts himself up on his elbow, peering at Childe with those endless orbs of amber. “Do you not change when you are with your family, as opposed to how you would normally act if you are with the Fatui?”\r\n\r\nObviously, yes. Childe would rather die than expose his siblings to what goes on with the Fatui. While everyone but Teucer is vaguely aware of his job as a Harbinger, Childe still tries to keep it from them as much as he can. \r\n\r\n“I have to, though. I won’t expose my family to my Fatui business.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” Zhongli says. “When you are with me… What is your facade?”\r\n\r\nWhat a strange question… Childe has never thought about hiding any part of himself when he’s around Zhongli; he’s seen what he’s like as a Harbinger, and he’s witnessed the chaos that’s his family. \r\n\r\n“I can be myself when I’m with you,” Childe answers. \r\n\r\n“And are you not yourself when you are with your family? Or when you are doing your job?”\r\n\r\nWhen Childe found out he was getting laid tonight, he didn’t think that included a thorough glance into his soul. Zhongli’s gaze feels like it’s trying to dig through all the complicating layers of his mind that even Childe himself refuses to understand. He has to break eye contact, frowning at the blankets as he sorts his thoughts through what Zhongli is asking. \r\n\r\nIt’s not that he puts on a facade. There’s different sides to him that are all real; he loves his family from the bottom of his heart and he wants what’s best for them, but there’s also another side to him that yearns for blood, to tear into every opponent and prove to the world that he’s strong, stronger than anyone out there. \r\n\r\n“I am… I just like to keep them all separate,” Childe mumbles. He turns back to Zhongli, eyeing the smudged eyeliner painted across his eyes. \r\n\r\nThe same applies for Zhongli. Childe is essentially separating whatever is going on between them from his own responsibilities. The longer he spends by Zhongli’s side, the more he forgets that he’s dedicated his life to another god. One day, he’s going to have to leave Liyue and return to the Tsaritsa’s side. \r\n\r\nIt’s pathetic how much Childe dreads that day. He’s grateful the Tsaritsa does not have the power to read thoughts; she would surely be disappointed to find him acting like this. \r\n\r\nShaking his head to himself, Childe forces out a laugh. “What’s with the sudden introspection into my soul, consultant? You\'re asking a lot of questions tonight.”\r\n\r\nZhongli rests his head back on his chest with a sigh. “Forgive me... I did not mean to intrude. You intrigue me, is all.”\r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t want to think anymore. He grips Zhongli’s waist and flips them over, wasting no time in claiming the god’s lips again. Moaning in approval, Zhongli’s arms wrap around his neck, thighs already parting for Childe to slot himself back inside. \r\n\r\n“Enough talking,” Childe says, groaning once he’s sheathed back into Zhongli’s warmth. “I’m not done with you yet, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\n“Yes… Yes,” Zhongli encourages, and it’s all Childe clings to. \r\n\r\nFor the rest of the night, he loses himself in Zhongli. There is only the addicting distraction of the body beneath him, veiled in a golden glow that makes him forget the world shrouded in shadows outside. This is all that matters; just the feel of Zhongli squeezing around him, crying his name again and again. He casts aside whatever the future has in store and accepts the delusion that Zhongli belongs to him. \r\n\r\nFor tonight, this is enough.', 'set_in_stone.jpg', '2021-04-25 23:02:00.649194', '2021-04-26 10:15:40.252413', '0', '1', 'set_in_stone_05', '1', '2', 'Set in Stone');

Groaning, he buries his face into his pillow in a futile attempt to force himself back to the void of sleep. He doesn’t want to wake up yet… He was having a very pleasant dirty dream about a certain six thousand year old ex-Archon...\r\n\r\nSoft laughter drifts around him, eerily similar to the voice his dreams were centred around ten seconds ago. \r\n\r\nWait. He’s not alone? \r\n\r\nChilde opens his eyes and is instantly met with a sight that literally knocks the breath out of his lungs. \r\n\r\nZhongli’s fingers card through his hair as he leans over him, basking in sunlight streaming from the open window. The blanket pooling around his waist allows Childe a perfect view of all the marks he claimed on Zhongli’s body, each one a lovely contrast against his marble skin. He’s back to the form Childe is used to seeing him in; the lack of geo sigils glowing up his arms makes Childe wonder if it was all a figment of his horny imagination. \r\n\r\n“G’morning…” Childe mumbles, rubbing his eyes. \r\n\r\nNoticing Childe is now awake, the smile on Zhongli’s face widens.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Ajax,” Zhongli says as he tucks a lopsided strand of Childe’s hair behind his ear. \r\n\r\nNope, he’s definitely awake. Just staring at Zhongli is making his heart pound faster than Pedrelino’s one month long Fatui training sessions. Childe has only woken up and he already feels like he’s ran ten laps around Zapolyarny Palace. \r\n\r\n“Have you been awake long?” he asks.\r\n\r\nZhongli shakes his head. Childe doesn’t know if it’s because he’s still half asleep or not, but he swears there’s a hint of amusement in Zhongli’s eyes as he continues to stroke his hair. It’s hardly fair at all. Childe is barely awake; he hasn’t prepared himself for the reality of waking up to Zhongli first thing in the morning. \r\n\r\nNot that he’s complaining. In fact, his traitorous brain is already starting to get attached to this very quickly. \r\n\r\n“You look very peaceful when you are sleeping,” Zhongli tells him. “Did you sleep well?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” Childe automatically says. Then, he remembers the countless times they woke throughout the night, only to find themselves tangled in each other’s limbs for hours on end. He laughs under his breath. “Although I don’t think either of us got much sleep last night…”\r\n\r\n“Hm… You are insatiable.”\r\n\r\nChilde smirks. “Don’t put this all on me, consultant. You’re just as shameless as I am.”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s eyebrows pinch together into a frown and he opens his mouth to retort, but Childe yanks him back down until he’s sprawled onto his chest. \r\n\r\n“I was just trying to get some sleep but someone kept seducing me throughout the night,” Childe teases. “Always begging for more, telling me to go faster or harder. You’re very demanding when you want to be, consultant—and also loud. Very loud. I think half of Liyue must have heard you.”\r\n\r\nThe frown on Zhongli’s face quickly goes away, replaced by a rosy blush that’s quickly spreading all over his cheeks. Childe has to swallow back his laughter. This is too easy.\r\n\r\n“You’re over exaggerating,” Zhongli says, avoiding his gaze. “I was not that loud.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that old Liyue saying again? The walls have ears?”\r\n\r\n“Childe.”\r\n\r\nChilde grins, now unable to stop the laughter spilling out of him. Zhongli’s eyes narrow dangerously, though the blush on his cheeks only makes Childe laugh even more. \r\n\r\n“Sorry, xiansheng, I’m only teasing.” He leans forward to nibble on the soft flesh of Zhongli’s earlobe. “Don’t worry; I’m the only one who heard you. Your secret is safe with me.”\r\n\r\nI’m the only one who\'s allowed to hear you like that, he almost says like the caveman he’s quickly turning into. It takes all of his mental strength to keep that to himself. \r\n\r\nZhongli hums into his touch, craning his head as Childe moves his lips down his neck, pressing kisses against all of the marks he’s left. He sucks on the largest hickey, secretly wishing he could immortalise it onto Zhongli’s skin for everyone to see. Clearly, his lust-driven brain was eager for this last night; he’d made sure the hickey was high enough to be seen over Zhongli’s clothes. \r\n\r\nBefore he can give the other hickeys more attention, Zhongli pushes at his chest until Childe’s back sinks into the bed. He looks up—and his brain instantly short circuits the moment he sees Zhongli straddling him.\r\n\r\nThis must be what it’s like to have a religious experience, Childe thinks as the blanket slips off Zhongli’s body, revealing creamy thighs covered in bruises and red marks. He’s going to engrave this image into his memory for the rest of his life. \r\n\r\nZhongli crouches down, kissing along Childe’s shoulder. \r\n\r\n“What is the story behind this scar?” he asks, stroking the jagged gash sliced through his collarbone. \r\n\r\n“Scaramouche. The little bastard.”\r\n\r\nZhongli glances up with a frown. \r\n\r\n“He’s another Harbinger. We get into fights often,” Childe explains, shrugging. “Don’t worry; I gave him a scar of his own too.”\r\n\r\nThe only response he receives is a bemused sigh. Zhongli travels down Childe’s body, tracing his lips along the line of his abs, paying extra attention to every scar he comes across. Childe has never felt self-conscious about his body, but the way Zhongli looks at him makes his head spin with questions. Why is he doing this? What is he thinking? \r\n\r\nZhongli sucks at a spot just below his stomach, evoking a hiss from the Harbinger. “And this?” \r\n\r\nJust like before, he strokes the line of the scar. It becomes increasingly difficult to think when he kisses it, breath hovering over Childe’s belly button.\r\n\r\n“Polar bear,” Childe chokes out.\r\n\r\n“Polar bear?”\r\n\r\n“They’re surprisingly fun to wrestle.”\r\n\r\nAnother sigh from Zhongli. His lips travel further down, kissing every expanse of Childe’s skin that he passes by. \r\n\r\nLips flutter over Childe\'s hipbones. “This?”\r\n\r\n“Treasure hoarder. Managed to get a lucky hit.”\r\n\r\n“It\'s unlike you to let someone best you in battle…”\r\n\r\nChilde pouts. “I still won that battle, xiansheng. I was just distracted for a few seconds. It was a bad day.”\r\n\r\n“Then forgive my assumption that you lost to a measly treasure hoarder,” Zhongli says with mirth seeping into his calm voice. He takes Childe\'s hand and kisses each knuckle, sending the Harbinger\'s heart cartwheeling. “Even your hands have scars.”\r\n\r\n“You\'re really fixated on the scars, huh.”\r\n\r\nZhongli looks up, smiling. “They fascinate me, although I wish you would take better care of yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I do take care of myself.”\r\n\r\nFlipping his hand over, Zhongli presses a kiss into Childe\'s palm, still locking eyes with him. He remains there for a moment, eyes so bright they make cor lapis seem dull, then slowly brushes his lips down to Childe\'s wrist, over the pulse point. \r\n\r\nNeither of them move. Childe knows Zhongli can feel how fast his pulse is underneath his lips. He doesn\'t want to move, in fear it\'ll break whatever trance the ex-Archon has him under. \r\n\r\nZhongli lifts his head slightly, golden eyes piercing, but unreadable. \r\n\r\n“You are only mortal, Childe,” he says. \r\n\r\nIs that a problem? Childe wants to ask. Does that make me any less desirable for you?\r\n\r\nHe keeps his mouth shut, swallowing the thick lump in his throat. \r\n\r\nFortunately, Zhongli returns to his exploration of Childe\'s body, tracing his lips over the circular scar just under his ribs. As soon as his gaze wanders away, Childe releases the breath he realises he’s been holding in all this time. \r\n\r\n“A bullet?” Zhongli asks. \r\n\r\nChilde nods, finding no strength for words at this point. \r\n\r\nZhongli moves further down, past his stomach. Childe almost groans out in frustration when he turns away from his obviously erect dick (godsdamn it), instead kissing the scar around his waist. \r\n\r\n“This?”\r\n\r\nZhongli really expects to have a conversation when his head is dangerously close to Childe’s dick? This is a new form of torture.\r\n\r\n“Ah…” Childe licks his lips, struggling to kick the gears of his brain to work again. “That’s one of the other Harbingers again. Dottore, I think. Or was it Signora… No, Signora’s is the scar on my back…”\r\n\r\n“I take it this is normal behaviour among the Harbingers?”\r\n\r\nChilde pushes himself up on his elbows. “Xiansheng, we all hate each other’s guts. A fight breaks out in the palace almost every day if we’re there.”\r\n\r\nZhongli beams at him. “Then I am glad you are here with me now.”\r\n\r\nOf course only Zhongli can say something like that with an angelic smile, all the while being inches away from a boner.\r\n\r\n“Xiansheng, you’re killing me here,” Childe says, flopping back onto the bed in defeat. \r\n\r\n“I’m doing nothing of the sort.” Zhongli’s hands stroke up his thighs, completely contradicting the words coming out of his mouth. “I enjoyed last night.”\r\n\r\nChilde snorts. “I know you did.”\r\n\r\n“I wish to repay you. Contracts should be beneficial for both sides…”\r\n\r\n“What?” Childe looks up. “Xiansheng, that’s not… You shouldn’t think too much about the—”\r\n\r\nWhatever he was going to say dies on his lips the moment Zhongli takes his cock into his mouth.  He’s completely unprepared for the wet warmth suddenly enveloping him, taking him further, further. \r\n\r\nChilde collapses onto the pillows. “Ah, shit.”\r\n\r\nZhongli doesn’t even stop. Childe watches with wide eyes as more and more of his dick disappears into the god’s mouth. He expected him to stop halfway, but Zhongli carries on. Holy shit, is he going to—\r\n\r\nZhongli chokes. He jerks away, coughing into his hand.\r\n\r\nIt takes an eternity for Childe to compose himself. After he gets through the shock that Zhongli just tried to deepthroat him, he sits up, rubbing Zhongli’s back as he continues to cough.\r\n\r\n“Don’t force yourself, xiansheng,” Childe says, even though the sex-obsessed caveman in his head is ridiculously turned on by the image of Zhongli choking on his dick. \r\n\r\nZhongli tucks his hair behind his ears and licks his lips. “No, allow me to try again. Please lie back down.”\r\n\r\nWell, Childe is certainly not going to stop him. He does as he’s told, watching as Zhongli positions himself in front of his cock again. \r\n\r\nThis time, he leans down and kisses the tip, so softly that Childe barely feels it. Zhongli’s hair cascades down his shoulders as he licks at the weeping head, lapping up the cum already leaking out. He does this a few times; tracing his tongue over the protruding veins of Childe’s length, then sucking at the head with an eagerness that almost makes the Harbinger come on the spot. Fuck, he’s never seen anything so hot in his life. \r\n\r\nChilde groans, closing his eyes at the sensation of Zhongli’s tongue lapping around him. As time passes, he feels Zhongli bob his head faster, lower, encouraged by every sound Childe lets out. \r\n\r\n“Shit, shit. Fuck…” Childe moans as Zhongli swallows more of his length. “Yes, fuck, that’s good…”\r\n\r\nZhongli pulls back with a wet pop. Childe observes in shocked fascination as he gathers drool by his mouth, lathering the tip of his cock before swirling his tongue around it. Spit drips down the length and Zhongli wastes no time licking it up, half-lidded eyes meeting Childe’s gaze as he takes his cock back into his warm mouth.\r\n\r\nHoly shit. Fuck. Childe’s either still dreaming or he’s dead. There’s no way this is real and Zhongli is actually doing any of this. \r\n\r\nWet heat surrounds Childe’s cock once more. Zhongli is bobbing his head up and down again, swallowing as much as he can. Each second that passes is maddening. Childe tries his best to stay still, to resist the urge to buck his hips forward, thrust up into Zhongli’s throat and fuck his face—fuck. \r\n\r\nZhongli grips onto his thighs, slowly pushing his head further down, down, all the while pausing to swallow around the length. \r\n\r\nMore, more—\r\n\r\n“Fuck, fuck, fuck, ” Childe curses. He doesn’t even realise he’s holding onto Zhongli’s head until he’s gripping a fistful of his hair, snapping his hips up. \r\n\r\nFar away, he hears the distant sound of Zhongli choking. \r\n\r\n“Fuck, sorry. Sorry,” Childe says, quickly letting go. \r\n\r\nLips swollen and cheeks red, Zhongli wipes at the drool and cum dripping out of his mouth. Ever since last night, the eyeliner usually drawn under his eyes is now long gone,  and his hair is tangled from the numerous times Childe has pulled on it. There\'s something very satisfying about the fact that Childe is probably one of the few people who has ever seen the ex-Archon so disheveled before.\r\n\r\n“N-No… Carry on,” Zhongli says. “Do it again, Childe.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure..?”\r\n\r\nZhongli nods. “Yes. I want you to enjoy yourself with my body. Please use me as you see fit.”\r\n\r\nChilde groans. “Xiansheng, you can’t just say those things to me… But, if you insist.”\r\n\r\nHe pushes Zhongli’s mouth down on his dick again, forcing him to swallow it to the base. Zhongli stiffens, nose pressed against Childe’s pubic hair, but he stays completely still and eventually relaxes against him. Childe gives him a few seconds to adjust before he grips both sides of his head and begins to fuck his throat. \r\n\r\nFuck, it’s so hot; he’s imagined Zhongli like this too many times but nothing comes close to the real thing. To his surprise, although he was struggling at first, Zhongli doesn’t appear to have a gag reflex. He moans every time Childe’s cock fucks his throat, and the vibrations only drive the Harbinger even more insane than he already is. \r\n\r\n“Shit, xiansheng, you’re so—hot,” Childe moans, snapping his hips forward with each word. The only way Zhongli responds to him is a muffled whine of his own. He strokes Childe’s thighs, as if silently encouraging him to carry on—not that Childe can stop himself at this point. \r\n\r\nHe fucks Zhongli’s face for Celestia knows how long, how short—Childe loses track of time. His thrusts become clumsy, hitting into the inside of Zhongli’s cheeks or the roof of his mouth. He can’t even see Zhongli’s face from this angle; only that his dick disappears into his mouth every few seconds, coupled with wet, gargled sounds whenever it hits the back of Zhongli\'s throat.\r\n\r\nChilde grits his teeth, chasing the pleasure building up in his gut—closer, closer. \r\n\r\n“I-I’m—fuck!” \r\n\r\nHe drives his hips forward one last time, shoving Zhongli’s face down in rhythm. In turn, Zhongli jerks in his grip, digging fingernails into Childe’s thighs—and still, Childe keeps him there, throwing his head back as he bursts. \r\n\r\nCelestia. Childe closes his eyes and revels at the pleasure gripping his entire body, spilling hot liquid down Zhongli’s throat. He can vaguely feel the god swallowing around him, trying his best to take everything. It’s only at the last second does Zhongli pull away, coughing as cum splatters onto his face and drips down his chin.\r\n\r\nChilde feels like a beast snapping at its cage. Lurching forward, he wrenches Zhongli onto his lap and pumps his cock into his fist until the god is writhing. Zhongli holds onto his shoulders as if it\'s the only thing grounding him; the desperate sounds coming out of his mouth spurring Childe to stroke him faster, tighter.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t take long to finish Zhongli off. Childe doesn\'t stop, not even when the god is finally crying out his name and coming in his arms, an addicting image that Childe has now engraved in his head since last night. So beautiful.\r\n\r\nWhen they’re done, Childe keeps Zhongli on his lap, kissing up the line of his jaw as he calms down from his high.\r\n\r\n“Gods, Zhongli. I could fuck you all day.”\r\n\r\nNot the most romantic thing that’s ever come out of his mouth, no, but they did settle on a friends with benefits kind of relationship—even if Childe’s stupid feelings have already gone way past that. \r\n\r\nZhongli takes a few more seconds to regain his breath, weakly shaking his head. “Not today... You have your meeting with Ningguang.”\r\n\r\nChuckling, Childe brushes back the strands of hair sticking onto Zhongli’s forehead. Gods, with the amount of times they had sex last night, both of them are filthy… \r\n\r\n“Alright, but we should get cleaned up first. How about we take a bath together?” Childe suggests.\r\n\r\nAt this, Zhongli purses his lips together. “I’m not naive, Childe. I know you will not stop at just bathing.”\r\n\r\nOuch. Childe clutches at his chest and feigns a gasp. “Zhongli-xiansheng, you must think so low of me… I was only suggesting it to save some time, considering this meeting with Ningguang is clearly very important… We shouldn’t miss that, should we?”\r\n\r\nZhongli doesn’t entertain him with a response, instead rising from Childe’s lap and slipping into a silk robe. Sighing, Childe lounges back on the bed and watches as Zhongli ties the robe around himself. It does very little to hide the numerous marks all over his body. \r\n\r\n“How did you know how to suck dick like that?” Childe asks, suddenly curious. “You continue to surprise me every time, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\nZhongli stops to think, tapping his chin as he gazes up at the ceiling in thought. “I have read books in the past that explored various sexual practices… As I recall, oral sex is supposed to be very pleasurable for both men and women.”\r\n\r\nSo, basically, Rex Lapis somehow stumbled across a section in the library full of erotic literature and decided to spend his benevolent spare time reading these for research. The life of an Archon is truly full of surprises. \r\n\r\n“I hope that was satisfactory for you,” Zhongli says, standing up straight with all the grace in the world, as if he doesn’t look like he’d just gotten mauled by a bear. “I must get washed and dressed. It’s best if you do the same.”\r\n\r\nHe takes a step forward—then stops, frowning down at himself. “Hm.”\r\n\r\nChilde raises an eyebrow at him. “What’s wrong?”\r\n\r\n“My legs are in pain.”\r\n\r\nAh… Childe scratches the back of his head. “Well, we did have sex all night…”\r\n\r\nZhongli breathes out a huff. “How inconvenient.”\r\n\r\nIt’s becoming increasingly difficult to hold back the grin threatening to spread across Childe’s face. No, he has to be serious now. Zhongli is in pain because they had sex too much. This isn’t something to be smiling about, and he definitely shouldn\'t feel proud about it either.\r\n\r\n“Does it hurt that much?” Childe pats the empty space next to him. “We could always stay in bed and forget all about Ningguang…”\r\n\r\n“No, it’s nothing I cannot handle. I have endured worse in the past.” Zhongli faces him, his gaze serious, eerily similar to how he would stare at jewellery before he made Childe buy them. “I’m more surprised that your sexual prowess is capable of having such long-lasting effects on my body. I clearly underestimated the stamina of mortals.”\r\n\r\nChilde blinks several times. Is this Zhongli’s way of praising the fact he managed to get it up enough times for them to have sex all night?\r\n\r\n“Um, thanks?” he slowly says. “I’m glad you… approve of my, um, stamina.”\r\n\r\nNodding once, Zhongli turns around, leaving Childe staring after him in both confusion and shock. He’ll never understand what goes through that man’s head. It’s going to take a while for him to process what just happened this past twenty-four hours. \r\n\r\nChilde slumps back into the blankets and stares up at the ceiling. He’s still stuck in the post-sex mindset, basking in the remnants of adrenaline. He’ll worry about the consequences of his actions when he returns home.\r\n\r\nFor now…\r\n\r\nZhongli pops his head out from the bathroom. “Childe? Are you not going to have a bath?”\r\n\r\nStill comfortable in bed, Childe cranes his head up and squints at him. “Eh? Sure, I’ll have one after you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Was it not your suggestion that we ought to bathe together?”\r\n\r\nSuddenly very interested in the direction of this conversation, Childe props himself up. “I was under the impression you were against that idea, xiansheng…” \r\n\r\nEven from across the room, he sees the unmistakable smile tugging on Zhongli’s lips. It lights up his eyes, making the god look younger than normal; almost… playful.\r\n\r\n“I have changed my mind,” Zhongli says, doing a poor job of hiding his smile behind his hand. “You\'d best come here before it changes again, Ajax...”\r\n\r\nChilde scrambles out of the bed so fast that he trips over the blanket. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter an eventful bath together that lasted far longer than it should have, Childe finds himself frowning at Wangsheng Funeral Parlour’s kitchen. For obvious reasons, many of the rooms are sealed off from customers, and he’d only ever visited this place to see Zhongli on rare occasions anyway. Even so, a kitchen is the last thing he expected from a funeral parlour—not that he knows what to expect from one aside from, well, dead bodies.\r\n\r\nZhongli sits down by one of the tables, looking every bit as refined and elegant as ever. It’s hard to take in that this is the same man who was moaning Childe’s name for the majority of last night, lithe legs wrapped around his waist as he…\r\n\r\nChilde smacks himself on the forehead. You’d think an entire evening of sex would satisfy his lust-driven mind, but apparently not. There’s no hope for him at this point. \r\n\r\n“I never knew you had a kitchen here, xiansheng,” he says, admiring the place to put a stop to his thoughts. It’s not just a small kitchen either; if he wasn’t aware this was the funeral parlour, Childe would think he’s currently inside a restaurant. \r\n\r\nZhongli straightens the vase of silk flowers at the centre of his table, arranging the stems so they are no longer drooping. “Yes, there was a period in which Hu Tao believed the funeral parlour would benefit from having a restaurant area to attract more customers.”\r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t even have to ask how that went. Everyone in Liyue is aware of Hu Tao and her eccentric approach in business. “Ah.”\r\n\r\n“As always, this business procedure was not successful, but the kitchen stayed. She enjoys experimenting with her unusual dishes here and often forces me to taste them.”\r\n\r\n“These don’t look half bad though,” Childe says, nodding towards a bowl of what seems to be cookies. He picks one of them up and sniffs it. Smells pretty good.\r\n\r\n“Childe, I would advise against eating that…”\r\n\r\nChilde takes a bite… and spits it out within seconds. \r\n\r\nHe hears Zhongli sigh as he’s still trying to spit out the taste of what can only be described as acid.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, her cooking is… below average,” Zhongli says.\r\n\r\nShuddering, Childe downs a whole glass of water and grimaces when he can still taste the cookie in his tongue. What did Hu Tao put in those things? Is she trying to poison people?\r\n\r\nThen again, considering how much she’s always looking for new customers, Childe wouldn’t put it past her to actually do that. \r\n\r\n“Forget below average, it’s damn lethal,” he says, drinking his second glass. \r\n\r\nOnce the taste has somewhat subsided, Childe searches through the kitchen, avoiding any of the food already laid aside in case they’re cooked by Hu Tao. If Hu Tao is the only person using this place, then she must love cooking a lot. Everything is neatly organized and the shelves are stocked with spices and fresh ingredients. \r\n\r\nThe cupboards, too, are filled with colourful jars; some of which look to be very questionable ingredients.  Childe soon closes the cupboard when he spots a jar of twitching eyeballs, deciding that those won’t be suitable ingredients for breakfast at all.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” Zhongli asks from where he’s sitting.\r\n\r\n“Cooking breakfast for us,” Childe answers. “What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind cooking, then I would enjoy some congee with a side portion of youtiao… Tea would be lovely too. I prefer oolong tea in the morning, but jasmine tea will suffice as well.”\r\n\r\nChilde scratches his head. The only tea he knows how to make is the sort with milk and sugar, and he doubts that’s what Zhongli wants. He’s not even sure what youtiao is… \r\n\r\n“I’m not very familiar with cooking Liyuen dishes…” Childe admits.\r\n\r\nZhongli smiles in reassurance. “In that case, you may cook whatever you’d like. I’m fine with anything, as long as it is not that soup you made when I first met your family.”\r\n\r\nChilde snorts. “That’s my best dish, xiansheng. You’re hurting my feelings.”\r\n\r\n“I apologise. I’m not very fond of seafood, especially if the tentacles are not chopped up…”\r\n\r\nHow very specific. Childe is tempted to ask what’s the reason for this strange aversion to tentacles, but he’ll save that for another day. \r\n\r\n“How about this: you can talk me through the recipe and I’ll cook it for you?” Childe suggests. “Was it congee and you..?”\r\n\r\n“Youtiao,” Zhongli finishes for him, standing up. He makes his way to the kitchen, and the pretty smile on his face makes Childe wonder if cooking will even be possible at this rate. “That is a good idea. They are fairly simple dishes too…”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Taste this,” Childe says, holding the spoon out for Zhongli. “How is it?”\r\n\r\nZhongli leans forward and opens his mouth, allowing Childe to pop the spoon inside. He spends a few seconds rolling the taste in his tongue, his expression so still that it’s impossible to tell if he likes the congee or not. \r\n\r\n“It could use more salt…” Zhongli eventually says, “but it is very good for your first attempt.”\r\n\r\nChilde grins at him. “Better than the soup?”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s eyes glint with amusement. “Much better.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs Zhongli said, the dishes he suggested are fairly simple and it doesn’t take long for Childe to cook them at all. They tuck into their breakfast afterwards, falling back into their usual rhythm of Zhongli talking about anything and everything while Childe listens to him.\r\n\r\nIt all feels so… normal. Even after last night, nothing has changed between them. \r\n\r\nNo, a more accurate description would be that it doesn’t feel normal. Childe’s pulse hasn’t calmed down since this morning and he can’t stop sneaking glances at Zhongli whenever he thinks he’s not looking. Every little action Zhongli does puts a smile on his face. He finds himself hyper fixating on small details he hasn’t noticed about the ex-Archon before; like how often he tucks the right side of his hair behind his ears as if it’s now become an unconscious habit. \r\n\r\nIt’s safe to say that sleeping with Zhongli has not quelled the strange feelings he evokes within Childe. Unfortunately, it ignited them, making it difficult for the Harbinger to focus on anything but Zhongli.\r\n\r\nWhat’s worse is that it feels natural. He’s had sex with Zhongli, woken up next to him, and now they’re eating breakfast together—and it feels as though he’s done this his entire life. As if it’s right. \r\n\r\nChilde is getting too attached to the idea of them being a couple. He can’t even remember what it was like before he met the man. He didn’t use to care about mundane, domestic things like this; none of it mattered if it wasn’t improving his strength in battle or benefitting the Tsaritsa. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, how long has it been since he last focused on being a Harbinger for Her Majesty? How long has it been since he’s acted like a Harbinger, and not just someone trying to spend as much of his time here in Liyue for as long as he can?\r\n\r\nThe answer is clear as day. Acknowledging it leaves a bad aftertaste in his mouth, making it difficult for him to swallow his breakfast. \r\n\r\n“Childe?” Zhongli’s voice drags him away from his thoughts. Childe looks up, finding concern in his eyes. “Is something the matter?”\r\n\r\nChilde plasters a smile on his face and hopes it looks genuine. To be safe, he laughs. “Just zoning out, xiansheng. I’m not a morning person, you see.”\r\n\r\nThankfully, it seems to work. Zhongli’s shoulders relax. “You were awake enough when we were in the bath together.”\r\n\r\nIt becomes easier to smile for real when the memories flutter back. “And now I’m getting sleepy again,” he says, teasing. “Maybe you should help wake me up, xiansheng.”\r\n\r\nZhongli sips his cup of tea, shaking his head to himself. “Insatiable.”\r\n\r\nSilence falls between them. Childe takes a bite out of a steamed bun, more out of a necessity to do something rather than to feed himself. He keeps his eyes fixed on Zhongli, watching as he eats the rest of his breakfast. \r\n\r\n“Are the other adepti aware of who you are?” Childe finds himself asking. As far as he can tell, only he and Lumine are aware of Zhongli’s true identity.\r\n\r\nIt always made him curious. For a funeral parlour consultant, Zhongli is highly regarded throughout Liyue Harbour. Many know him for his lectures and endless trivia of knowledge, and there are even a handful of people who swoon over him for his looks. Despite this, Childe rarely sees Zhongli with other people. Zhongli told him he had a few archeologist friends whom he goes to the Pearl Galley with, but aside from that, Childe has always seen him alone.\r\n\r\nZhongli looks up and shakes his head. “I do not think so. I hinted to both the Qixing and the adepti that Rex Lapis is not actually dead. As for the fact that I am Rex Lapis… They are not aware of this, no.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you tell them?”\r\n\r\n“They are surviving well without me. I’m no longer needed.”\r\n\r\nThe emotions—or lack thereof—in his voice causes Childe to frown. “But weren’t you friends with the adepti? Don’t you miss them?”\r\n\r\nZhongli tilts his head at him as if he’s speaking a different language. Childe has to suppress the urge to sigh.\r\n\r\n“You once told me you liked Osmanthus wine because it tastes the same as you remember it... But the people who share those memories with you are long gone. You miss them because they’re gone and you’re still here,” Childe explains, hoping his words make sense. \r\n\r\nIt’s moments like this that he remembers the gap between him and Zhongli. There’s thousands and thousands of years separating the two of them; Childe can’t even begin to fathom how Zhongli’s mind works.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you miss Xiao and Ganyu?” Childe continues on when Zhongli doesn’t provide him with a response. \r\n\r\nZhongli raises his eyebrows at that. “I was not aware you knew them.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve met them once or twice. Lumine sometimes drags them along to help with her commissions for the Adventurer’s Guild. She’s good friends with them.”\r\n\r\nStiffly, Zhongli nods. “I see. How are they?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not exactly the best person to ask, xiansheng. As you recall, I did summon Osial back and almost destroyed Liyue in the process. I don’t think Xiao and Ganyu like me very much.”\r\n\r\nZhongli breathes out a humourless huff. “How could I forget?”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t answer my question,” Childe says, quickly backtracking. It’s probably best not to bring up the whole Osial thing again. Reminding your fake boyfriend/lover/fiance that you once set out to destroy his beloved land is not a good relationship phase. “Don’t you miss them?”\r\n\r\nZhongli sets his spoon down, pushing his bowl away. “I often find myself reminiscing about old days, so I believe I do… but it is not a feeling I’m unfamiliar with. When you have lived for as long as I have, it is inevitable to say goodbye to those who are important to you. I will always treasure them in my memories.”\r\n\r\n‘When you have lived for as long as I have.’ Childe scoffs at that before he can stop himself. Zhongli says it so casually as though anyone can relate to living for as long as he has. Of course, for someone as old as he is, it’s no surprise that Zhongli is used to parting with people, even those whom he considers as close friends. \r\n\r\n‘You are only mortal, Childe.’ \r\n\r\nIsn’t that what Zhongli told him earlier? If Zhongli is so used to parting ways with his friends—most of whom are adepti—then what impact can Childe hope to make in his long, long existence?\r\n\r\nWhat significance can a human ever create in a god’s life? \r\n\r\nIt shouldn’t bother him, but it does. Childe stirs in an ugly feeling of helplessness and frustration, knowing that, no matter how much he tries, he can never close the gap between him and Zhongli. \r\n\r\n“For someone who wants to live a mortal life, xiansheng, you sure don’t act like it,” Childe mutters. He doesn’t mean to say it out loud, and he already regrets his words as soon as they leave his tongue. \r\n\r\nZhongli presses his lips together, eyes narrowing. “What are you insinuating?”\r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t even know anymore. They were talking about Xiao and Ganyu before he let his silly feelings creep into this topic. He breathes in, shoving aside his emotions, and decides it’s best to return to the original conversation.\r\n\r\n“Nothing. I… I was just thinking that if you want to see your friends, go see them. Who cares if your duties are finished? That doesn’t mean they can’t see you anymore.”\r\n\r\n“I am no longer needed,” Zhongli repeats. “Their contract with me ended the moment Rex Lapis was assumed dead to the world. They are fine without me.”\r\n\r\nChilde clenches his jaw, trying his best to keep his face neutral. Unfortunately, he can’t quite control his voice as well as his expressions. “It’s always contracts with you, isn’t it…” \r\n\r\nIt’s not the lack of emotion both in his words and his face that bothers Childe, no, but the reminder that, even when he has now cast aside his title as the God of Contracts, Zhongli’s life still very much revolves around them.\r\n\r\nChilde has to wonder if this is what Zhongli will be like once their contract is done. It’s only sinking into him now that everything really is set in stone. Once these two weeks are done, Zhongli will carry on as if nothing has happened, while Childe is stuck with feelings that have begun to drag him away from the Tsaritsa, from his home, from his duties as a Harbinger—everything he’s ever known, everything that made sense in his life. \r\n\r\nZhongli reaches across the table, laying his palm over Childe’s hand. The soft touch of his skin is enough to remind Childe that none of this is Zhongli’s fault. He should have thought about the consequences of making a deal with the God of Contracts—let alone falling for him. \r\n\r\n“Ajax..?” Zhongli calls. The evident concern in his voice, coupled with the use of that name, only makes Childe feel worse. \r\n\r\nBefore he can force a smile on his face and reassure Zhongli that he’s fine, the door bursts wide open.\r\n\r\nHu Tao stands at the kitchen’s doorway, wide eyes flickering between Zhongli, Childe, and then their joined hands. When five seconds of awkward silence pass, Childe gradually pulls his hand away and sits back on his chair. \r\n\r\n“Do I want to ask why lover boy is here so early in the morning?” Hu Tao asks, snickering in Childe’s direction.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Hu Tao,” Childe greets. He’s well aware of Zhongli’s gaze still fixed on him, clearly reluctant to forget their conversation before Hu Tao kindly barged in. \r\n\r\nThank Celestia for small miracles. Childe ignores Zhongli and pats the chair beside him, beckoning the younger woman to join them. \r\n\r\n“I made breakfast,” he says. “There’s plenty left for you.”\r\n\r\nHu Tao plops down on the seat and wastes no time in stealing one of the steamed buns from Zhongli’s plate.\r\n\r\n“I heard the two of you were very busy in the Galley last night…” she says as she takes a huge bite. \r\n\r\nSighing, Zhongli scoops up congee into an empty bowl and offers it to her, along with a handful of youtiao on the side.\r\n\r\nChilde wonders if something similar to this happens every morning. There’s something very amusing about Zhongli spending much of his mortal life isolated from the adeptus, and yet he’s here being hounded by an over-excited funeral director who also happens to be his boss. \r\n\r\n“Yes, we succeeded in catching the murderer,” Zhongli explains.\r\n\r\nAlthough he’s just given her a plate of her own, Hu Tao seizes youtiao off Zhongli’s plate, ignoring the exasperated look he gives her. \r\n\r\nShe laughs. “I heard, I heard! People are already saying it was Mr. Fatui Harbinger over here who was the murderer.”\r\n\r\nChilde rolls his eyes. “Of course they would.”\r\n\r\n“We will speak to Ningguang soon to settle this matter,” Zhongli reassures him.\r\n\r\n“Even so… I don’t think that’s going to stop everyone from being scared of him,” Hu Tao says with a mouthful of congee, pointing her spoon at Childe. “I’m surprised you’re still allowed to stay here.”\r\n\r\nShe’s not the only one. After the Osial incident, Childe’s plan was to leave for Snezhnaya as soon as Signora left—which he clearly didn’t stick to, considering he’s still here. If it weren’t for his terrifying reputation, Childe thinks everyone in Liyue would have tried to force him out of town by now. He wouldn’t put it past them to do this eventually. \r\n\r\nWhy is he still here anyway? The Tsaritsa can easily assign someone else to oversee the Northland Bank; Ekaterina practically runs that place with her eyes closed anyway. Childe is mainly there to keep up with reports and debt collection, ensuring that no one conveniently forgets to pay back their loans.\r\n\r\nHis eyes flicker to a certain consultant. Ha. As if he ever stayed here in Liyue for the Northland Bank. The sad truth is that he’s been stalling his departure because he’s too busy fawning over the ex-Archon who deceived him. \r\n\r\nHe’d long forgiven Zhongli for that. It had angered him at first, mainly because he hates being made a fool of, but it didn’t take long for him to swallow his pride and accept the man’s apology. \r\n\r\nAlthough… The fact that Zhongli didn’t think twice about using him for his own gain does hurt a bit more now that Childe has grown stupidly attached to him—but it was all for the sake of his contract with the Tsaritsa, wasn’t it? \r\n\r\nZhongli and his oh-so-important contracts. \r\n\r\n“Hey, you still there?” Hu Tao waves her hand in front of Childe’s face. \r\n\r\nChilde blinks, shaking himself out of it. Drat, what is up with him overthinking this morning? One night of sex with the man he unfortunately likes and suddenly his head is filled with depressing thoughts. \r\n\r\n“Yeah, yeah, sorry. Still sleepy,” Childe says, scratching his head. “Anyway, it’s not like I’ll be here forever. When I leave, everyone can have their parties.”\r\n\r\nHe doesn’t miss the way Zhongli frowns at that. \r\n\r\nHu Tao winks and the grin slowly spreading across her face is one that Childe knows all too well. “Aw, before you leave, remember; because you’re a business partner, you have a twenty-five percent discount on your funeral plan with us. The life of a Fatui Harbinger is very dangerous! You should plan ahead while you still can! Nobody wants an unplanned funeral!”\r\n\r\nZhongli pinches the bridge of his nose. “Hu Tao.”\r\n\r\nHu Tao tries, and fails, to sober her grin up. “Uh-oh. Someone’s getting touchy.”\r\n\r\nThat little comment from her only causes Zhongli’s shoulders to tense up. Strange. What’s gotten into him all of a sudden?\r\n\r\nZhongli stands up. “Childe, we must leave now. Finish your breakfast.”\r\n\r\n“Uh…” Childe glances at Hu Tao, who only shrugs helplessly at him. When he looks back up at Zhongli, he’s surprised to find he’s already making his way for the door. \r\n\r\nChilde scrambles to catch up with him. “I’m coming, I’m coming. See you, Hu Tao!”\r\n\r\nHu Tao waves at them. “Good luck. You’re going to need it... Oh yeah—wait!”\r\n\r\nBoth Zhongli and Childe freeze by the door, staring at the funeral director with matching, puzzled expressions. \r\n\r\n“The two of you might want to use some make-up on your necks first though,” Hu Tao says, motioning to her own neck.\r\n\r\nIn unison, Childe and Zhongli turn to each other. \r\n\r\nAh. That’s right. It couldn’t be any more obvious that they’ve had an… eventful night if they were to go out in public like this. \r\n\r\nHu Tao lets out an exaggerated sigh. “Aiya, you two are shameless!”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWalking into Yuehai Pavillion feels very much like handing himself over to the Qixing to get arrested. If it weren’t for Zhongli with him, Childe is convinced there’d be a fight breaking out here by now. Or maybe that’s just wishful thinking. He certainly won’t be complaining if a fight does occur, but he doubts Zhongli will be happy about it. \r\n\r\nMuch to his disappointment, they are led into Ningguang’s office without any need for battle. Upon walking inside, he spots the Tianquan sitting by her desk, sipping a dainty cup of tea. Ningguang glances up, and the only change that flutters through her face is a slight raise of her eyebrows. \r\n\r\nHm. Maybe she’s still pissed about the destruction of her precious Jade Chamber. In Childe’s defense, it was her decision to destroy that thing. He didn’t exactly expect anyone to subdue Osial by dropping a large building into the ocean. \r\n\r\n“Thank you for coming,” Ningguang says as soon as both of them sit opposite her. She offers them a cup of tea and Childe politely declines, not exactly in the mood to drag this on for longer than necessary. \r\n\r\nA smile graces Ningguang’s red lips, but Childe knows a fake smile when he sees it. He responds by offering her one of his own. \r\n\r\n“First off, while your methods were questionable, let me thank you for catching the murderer at the Pearl Galley,” Ningguang says. “Rest assured, he is now behind bars and will no longer bring harm to the people of Liyue.”\r\n\r\nHer voice is calm and serene, like she’s talking about an inconvenient sale gone wrong rather than a murderer. \r\n\r\nChilde nods. “You’re welcome. But I trust you didn’t just summon me here to show your gratitude.”\r\n\r\nAt this, the Tianquan’s smile drops. The flash of amusement in her ruby eyes is the most genuine emotion Childe has seen on her so far. \r\n\r\n“No. You are correct,” she says. “I summoned you here because I believe your departure from Liyue is long overdue.”\r\n\r\nChilde vaguely hears Zhongli sucking a breath in. In the corner of his eyes, he sees that the ex-Archon’s hands are slowly clenching into fists.\r\n\r\nNingguang tilts her head. “You understand why I am being blunt. What you have done in the past is no small matter to be overlooked and forgotten. It is also no secret that many in Liyue are wary of your presence. You cause unrest wherever you go. Frankly, I do not understand why you are still here.”\r\n\r\nI don’t know either, Childe almost says. \r\n\r\nOr, rather, he knows why he’s still here, and the reason is in the form of the man sitting right next to him. \r\n\r\nIt’s just not a reason he can hold onto for much longer. \r\n\r\nAll he can do is remain silent and stare blankly at the table in front of him. He always knew he’d have to leave Liyue eventually. As much as he’s grown attached to this place, staying here permanently was never an option. He’s practically a criminal in the eyes of Liyuens. Even if that weren’t the case, Childe has his own duties to return to. His own god to return to. \r\n\r\nZhongli clears his throat. “If I may speak… I have been keeping Childe here and I would like for him to stay. He and I have become… involved with each other.”\r\n\r\nHuh? Childe turns to Zhongli, not expecting those words to come out of his mouth. He knows they’re supposed to be faking a relationship, but that was just for his family! \r\n\r\nNingguang’s cold gaze stays on them for far too long. “Is this in regards to your engagement with him?” \r\n\r\nChilde didn’t know the Qixing were aware of that—wait, why do they even know? Have the rumours gone that far?\r\n\r\n“I had thought it only a baseless rumour… but it seems it was true after all,” Ningguang muses. She seems to be lost in thought for a while, tapping a finger on her chin while her eyes flicker between them. “Regardless of your relationship, consultant, surely you must know that his presence here in Liyue is unwelcome, and for valid reasons.”\r\n\r\n“I am aware.”\r\n\r\n“And you?” Ningguang raises an eyebrow at Childe. “Do you not have other responsibilities elsewhere?”\r\n\r\n“I…” Childe swallows. Yes. Yes, he does. \r\n\r\nEven if, by some miracle, he’s allowed to stay in Liyue, he’ll eventually have to go once he’s summoned back by the Tsaritsa. Really, he’s fucking himself over by staying here. \r\n\r\nThe longer he remains by Zhongli’s side, the more he doesn’t want to leave. He’s gone and gotten himself attached to the one thing he never thought he’d ever want in his life, and that’s the idea of settling down with someone he cares about. \r\n\r\nCelestia, what a mess. Zhongli is only with him now because of their stupid contract—and that’s the last thing Childe should be concerned about when he’s a Harbinger. If anything, he should be focusing on the Tsaritsa—on battle, training; all of those things he used to revolve his life around before Zhongli came in and ruined everything. \r\n\r\nFor the shortest of seconds, Childe wishes he hated Zhongli instead. He’s always barrelled through life without a second thought, thinking himself untouchable as long as he focused on his goals. Now, he doesn’t know what he wants, or better yet, what he can have.\r\n\r\nChilde hates it. He’s never felt so lost in his entire life. \r\n\r\nNingguang taps the table, waiting. The rhythm of her long nails drumming on the mahogany surface reminds Childe of the ticking of a clock. \r\n\r\nZhongli lays a hand on his palm, the same way he did over breakfast. Like before, his amber eyes are filled with concern. It’s ridiculous how much Childe wants to lean into him and accept the comfort he offers, forgetting about everything else. \r\n\r\n“I’d like to stay,” he finds himself saying, despite everything. “For as long as I’m able to.”\r\n\r\nNingguang narrows her eyes at his answer. “You understand the severity of your crimes, no? You summoned an ancient creature back from the depths, wreaking havoc upon Liyue, and now you\'re requesting permission to stay here for your own pleasure.”\r\n\r\nChilde thanks Celestia he’s good at controlling his facial expressions. If not, he’d be grimacing at the Tianquan’s words by now. \r\n\r\nIn the end, Ningguang sighs and waves her hand in dismissal, all polite pretences cast aside. \r\n\r\n“Do as you wish. For now, I will not stop you, but rest assured, if the situation escalates or if you threaten to disrupt the peace of Liyue again…”\r\n\r\n“I take full responsibility over him,” Zhongli says. \r\n\r\nNingguang is pouring more tea for herself, as though the matter is now completely out of her hands. However, Childe’s heard lots of stories about Liyue’s Tianquan. She’s a professional business woman who has worked hard to get to where she is today. She would not cast aside something like this so easily. \r\n\r\nChilde bristles in his seat. Something tells him that Ningguang is fully aware he won’t be able to stay in Liyue, regardless of whether he wants to or not. \r\n\r\n“Very well. You may leave now,” she says, offering them that same smile that does not reach her blood-red eyes. \r\n\r\nThis time, Childe can’t bring himself to smile back. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“You didn\'t have to do that, you know,” Childe says as soon as he and Zhongli step out into Yujing Terrace. “I can\'t stay here forever.”\r\n\r\nYujing Terrace is blindingly bright. Childe squints up at the sun, shielding his eyes from its midday rays. In the distance, he hears the sound of children laughing as they chase each other, enjoying the weather. Even the guards seem to be in a jovial mood. The usual guard standing outside of Yuehai Pavillion is whistling to himself, not bothering to spare a scowl in Childe’s direction like he did earlier. \r\n\r\n“Are you leaving soon?” Zhongli asks. Basked in sunlight, he looks almost heavenly standing in front of Childe. It’s a shame the weather is so good when they’re having a conversation such as this. \r\n\r\n“Not soon. I don\'t think so anyway,” Childe mumbles. “But as soon as the Tsaritsa summons me back, I\'ll have to leave.”\r\n\r\n“Oh. Will you not come back?”\r\n\r\nChilde looks away. “I… I don\'t think I can. Or should.”\r\n\r\nHe keeps his eyes on the children in the distance, watching them run around in circles. It’s only when he realises that Zhongli has not responded does he turn back to him. \r\n\r\n“Sorry for dragging you into this mess. It must be damaging to your reputation to be associated with someone like me,” Childe adds.\r\n\r\nZhongli shakes his head. “Reputation does not concern me.”\r\n\r\nOf course it doesn’t. Childe never thought for a minute that Zhongli would let something like gossip bother him, although that doesn’t mean that he feels okay with the thought of dragging the ex-Archon into his mess. \r\n\r\nAt the very least, Childe doesn’t think the rumours will remain for very long once he leaves Liyue. Zhongli will be able to go back to normal life soon, surely. \r\n\r\n“When you leave, does that mean I will never see you again?” Zhongli suddenly asks. \r\n\r\nChilde isn’t quick enough to stop the grimace flashing through his face in time. He wants to say yes. He wants to think that he’s sensible enough to leave Liyue behind and focus on what he should be focusing on. He wants to convince himself he can move on from this. \r\n\r\nInstead, he gives Zhongli a reassuring smile. “I can visit, if I have time. And you\'re always welcome to come see me in Snezhnaya.”\r\n\r\nStupid, stupid, stupid.\r\n\r\nZhongli’s eyes cast downwards. “But I will no longer see you as often as I do now.”\r\n\r\nFor the entirety of the time he’s known Zhongli, Childe’s aware the ex-Archon doesn’t show much emotion on the outside; and even on the inside, he has to wonder just how much Zhongli is capable of feeling… Still, he looks so small and… almost upset now. Childe takes a step closer, ducking down in an attempt to meet his eyes. \r\n\r\n“Zhongli-xiansheng—?”\r\n\r\n“Ajax, there you are!” A voice calls out, making him jump away from Zhongli. Childe follows the source and spots his family walking towards them.\r\n\r\nHis mother waves at him. “We\'ve been wondering where you disappeared off to,” she says.\r\n\r\nChilde scratches the back of his neck. “Oh, yes, sorry I\'ve been with Zhongli since our date.”\r\n\r\nHis mother lets out a dreamy sigh, the kind that probably means she’s thinking about his non-existent future wedding with Zhongli again. “Honestly, you two are inseparable… It\'s just like when me and Gavriil were young…”\r\n\r\nZhongli bows his head down. “I apologise for keeping your son…”\r\n\r\nTo Childe’s horror, his father smacks Zhongli on the back so hard that even the ex-Archon’s eyes widen in shock. “It\'s fine, Mr. Zhongli. As long as someone\'s keeping an eye on him then we can be sure he\'s not causing trouble!”\r\n\r\nChilde gently pulls Zhongli back to his side, away from the dangers of being smacked by his father or crushed by a hug from his mother. \r\n\r\n“Alright, alright, what are you all doing here anyway?” he asks, frowning at all of the shopping bags his siblings are carrying. Looks like his family have finally gone on their tourist shopping trip, it seems. \r\n\r\n“We went shopping!” Teucer says. The wide grin on his face is enough to tell Childe that he’s gotten enough new toys to last him a while.\r\n\r\n“And we were looking for restaurants to go to for my birthday tomorrow!” Tonia adds. “You... haven’t forgotten, have you?”\r\n\r\nChilde pokes her on the forehead. “Princess, how could you even think I’d ever forget your birthday?  I’m offended.”\r\n\r\nTonia giggles, swatting his hand away.\r\n\r\nAnthon latches onto Childe’s elbow, shaking him. “But Sister Tonia decided in the end that she didn\'t want to go to a restaurant after all. She wants to stay at home! Brother, tell her that\'s boring!”\r\n\r\n“It\'s my birthday!” Tonia huffs. “I just… I just want it to be our family. We haven\'t had Brother with us in years and I want it to be special.”\r\n\r\nChilde stiffens as guilt claws at him. He’s never missed any of his little siblings’ birthdays, always sending them the biggest crate of toys to make up for the fact he can’t be with them. The endless gifts helped delude him into thinking it was enough when, of course, it wasn’t. \r\n\r\nHe pulls his little sister into a hug, patting down her unruly curls. “I\'ll make it the best day for you, Tonia. Anything you want.”\r\n\r\nTonia’s smile may as well be brighter than the sun itself. She turns to Zhongli with a spring in her step. “Mr. Zhongli, you should come along too!”\r\n\r\nZhongli blinks. He looks at Childe, then back at her. “I do not wish to intrude if this is something between your family…”\r\n\r\n“Don\'t be silly! You\'re part of our family now, aren\'t you?”\r\n\r\n“Tonia’s right, Mr. Zhongli. We\'d love to have you along,” Childe’s father says. “And I’m sure Ajax would love that too, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nEach member of his family turns to him. If Childe dared to refuse, he’s certain he\'d never hear the end of it.\r\n\r\nHow strange. With Zhongli standing amidst his family, it looks exactly like the life his parents want for him. Perhaps in an alternate world, this is the sort of life Ajax would settle down into. \r\n\r\n“I certainly have no objections,” Childe says. \r\n\r\nZhongli nods, bowing in Tonia’s direction and causing her to giggle. “Then I accept your invitation. Thank you, Miss Tonia.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“They adore you, you know,” Childe says.\r\n\r\nSide by side, he walks with Zhongli through the harbour, keeping his eyes on the distant figures of his family in front of them. At this time of the day, the harbour is ripe with activity. Many of the sailors are stopping for their lunch breaks, and the merchants take advantage of this by trying to entice them with cheap prices and fresh food. A few try to call out to Zhongli as well, recognising him as one of their gullible customers, but the ex-Archon doesn\'t entertain them today. \r\n\r\n“My family. They love you,” Childe repeats when Zhongli doesn’t respond. He’s been awfully quiet ever since the meeting with Ningguang. “My parents are practically in love with you and my siblings won\'t stop asking about you whenever we\'re home. At this rate, I\'m starting to think they like you more than they like me.”\r\n\r\n“Don\'t be silly. Your family think the world of you,” Zhongli says, then adds, “I am very fond of your family too.”\r\n\r\n“I\'m glad. I know I was asking a lot from you when we started this contract, but I really appreciate it. I don’t trust a lot of people to know about my family.”\r\n\r\nChilde says the last sentence so quietly that he wonders if Zhongli hears it. It’s true; he’s always avoided letting anyone get close to his family. \r\n\r\nOne of his biggest fears is that, one day, his own existence will endanger the people he loves. There’s a reason why he desperately tries to keep all aspects of his life separate.\r\n\r\nIt’s the control that helps keep him sane. If he can bathe himself in blood for the Tsaritsa, then he can easily wash off all evidence of that and go back to being the doting brother his siblings know and love him for. As long as he keeps that separate then his family will be safe and he can carry on being the weapon he’s destined to be. \r\n\r\nThat’s how it’s always been, anyway. \r\n\r\n“It has been my pleasure. Thank you for allowing me to meet them,” Zhongli says, and the smile on his face makes Childe want to lean in and steal a kiss. \r\n\r\nHe stays rooted on the spot. \r\n\r\nBefore he met Zhongli, Childe was convinced all that mattered in his life was to be as strong as he could possibly be. That was his greatest desire. No matter how foolish and naive it sounded, all he wanted was to gain power so strong that it’d feel as if the world could crumble at his feet. \r\n\r\nAnd now? \r\n\r\nNow, his greatest desire has taken the form of this man walking right beside him. How is he supposed to gain this? This isn’t something he can train for. Nothing he’d ever done in his life has prepared him for the challenge that’s Zhongli himself. \r\n\r\nIt’s frustrating how Childe wants several things at once. He feels as if his head is being split apart, and all of his duties, desires, promises—everything is yelling at him to pick them, pick them. \r\n\r\n“Childe?”\r\n\r\nHe glances up. Ah. He’d been so lost in his thoughts that he didn’t realise he’d stopped walking. \r\n\r\n“Are you alright?” Zhongli asks. “I can’t help but notice that you have been quiet today.”\r\n\r\nChilde’s first instinct is to lie, as always. It would be the best thing to do. His contract with Zhongli will soon finish, and hopefully the distance between them after that will clarify Childe’s head once again. He just needs to be patient.\r\n\r\nBut he’s never been a patient man, and he’s even worse at lying. \r\n\r\n“Xiansheng, I-I need to tell you something,” Childe blurts out as several thoughts fly through his head, something along the lines of: This is a bad idea. You need to shut up. No, just fucking tell him. No, what the fuck are you doing? Shut up—\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Zhongli steps closer, close enough for Childe to catch scent of that floral soap he used earlier. \r\n\r\n“About our contract.”\r\n\r\nZhongli’s eyes widen. “Oh?”\r\n\r\nChilde sucks in a deep breath. His heart is hammering so hard against his ribs that he’s becoming light headed. \r\n\r\n“I was thinking that… I know that we, uh, established certain rules for it but…” he sighs, frustrated. How is he going to say this? “I need to—I need to tell you that I—”\r\n\r\n“Lord Harbinger.”\r\n\r\nThe unexpected interruption is like a douse of freezing cold water. Childe snaps his head to the direction of the voice, frowning at the Fatui recruit hesitantly approaching him. \r\n\r\n“A-A moment, please. It’s urgent.”\r\n\r\nChile resists the urge to sigh. Nodding, he follows the recruit into a darkened alleyway between the boulevard, safely hidden from prying eyes.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Childe asks, keeping a lookout for anyone, just in case. \r\n\r\nThe recruit hands him something. A letter. \r\n\r\n“We received this letter for you.”\r\n\r\nChilde recognises Pulcinella’s seal within seconds. He rips it open, scanning through his superior’s messy scrawl. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTartaglia,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere has been a change of plans. After some discussion, we’ve decided that you are no longer required to stay in Liyue. Make haste to return to Zapolyarny Palace as soon as you are able to. We will decide on your next mission here. \r\n\r\nIt is about time you returned home. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nPulcinella\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChilde doesn’t know how long he spends staring at the letter, reading each line again and again in case there’s another meaning to it—but this is Pulcinella, not Scaramouche, or Signora, or Dottore, who excel in fucking around with his head just for the sake of it. \r\n\r\nThere’s no other meaning. His time is up and he needs to return home. It’s as simple as that. \r\n\r\nEach word is like an icy claw that digs itself back into his skin, reminding him of where he needs to be. He can feel the cold mask of Tartaglia slipping back, and the change is so abrupt, so rapid, that he nearly allows a bubble of deranged laughter to escape him. \r\n\r\nTo think he almost told Zhongli about his feelings… \r\n\r\nTartaglia crumples the letter into his fist. No, this is good. He needed this reminder. Pulcinella’s letter couldn’t have come at a better time. \r\n\r\n“Thanks. I got it,” he says. “Did this just arrive today?”\r\n\r\nThe recruit nods. “Yes, sir. One of our falcons sent it.”\r\n\r\nHm. If they’re using the falcons then it must be urgent. Probably sent it yesterday. \r\n\r\n“You can go now,” Tartaglia dismisses. The recruit bows stiffly at him and scampers off into the sunlight. \r\n\r\nWhen he returns, Zhongli is staring at him with the same concern that’s been on his face all day. This time, Tartaglia can’t bear to look at him. He keeps his eyes fixed on the street before them, thinking of home, the Tsaritsa; anything to keep him grounded. \r\n\r\n“Is everything okay?” Zhongli asks, his voice quiet. \r\n\r\n“It’s nothing. I’m fine.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind me asking, what did the Fatui agent wish to talk to you about?”\r\n\r\nTartaglia lets out a sharp laugh. “Nosy, aren’t you, xiansheng? Fatui business is top secret business.”\r\n\r\nHe doesn’t have to look at Zhongli to know he’s frowning at him. “I was under the impression Wangsheng Funeral Parlour and the Fatui were business partners.”\r\n\r\n“Hm, but you’re not asking because of business, are you, xiansheng?”\r\n\r\nSilence. Zhongli drops the subject and Tartaglia resists the temptation to look at him. They continue to walk side by side, though the distance between them now feels uncomfortable, like a wound that refuses to stop bleeding. \r\n\r\nIn the corner of his eyes, he sees Zhongli turn to him. “What did you want to discuss before? You mentioned our contract?”\r\n\r\n“Forget about it,” Tartaglia says. He finally allows himself to face the ex-Archon, flashing him a smile. “It’s not important anymore.”', 'set_in_stone.jpg', '2021-04-25 23:05:18.971872', '2021-04-26 10:15:45.700522', '0', '1', 'set_in_stone_06', '1', '2', 'Set in Stone');

'「はぁっ！」\r\n\r\n地下に突如ぽっかりと空いた穴の底で、空達はここ数日の璃月で起きている地震の原因と推測されているエンシャントヴィシャップと戦闘していた。刃を少しも通さぬ硬い皮膚に弾かれた空の剣がビリビリと振動し、腕に大きな負担がかかる。その反動に後退り、太く大きな尻尾が目の前に降り掛かって来たが空は体制を整えられていない。\r\n\r\n「っ…！」\r\n\r\nやられる、と本能で思った瞬間。\r\n一瞬の光に包まれたかと思えば、空の後方で鍾離が元素爆発による隕石をヴィシャップに落としシールドが空に付与され、空へ降り掛かる尻尾は崖の上にいるタルタリヤの弓矢により軌道がずれて空の右横寸前に落ちる。鍾離の隕石が直撃したヴィシャップは大きな悲痛の鳴き声をあげてそのまま地面へと沈み、静かに塵となっていった。\r\n\r\n「相棒、大丈夫かい？」\r\n「無事か、旅人」\r\n\r\n鍾離の強さに唖然としている空の元へ二人が駆け寄ってくる。隕石の衝撃で起きた風圧で汚れた頬の土を拭いながらこくりと頷いた。\r\n\r\n「ありがとう。助かった」\r\n「一人で間合いに入る度胸は認めるけど、俺達がいなかったら危なかったよ？」\r\n「公子殿に賛同だ。あまり無茶はするものではないな」\r\n「ごめん」\r\n\r\n金色の髪を揺らし伏せ目がちに謝る空に、サポートするのが俺達の役目だと若いながらに日頃から上司という立場であるタルタリヤが援護した。こういう言葉がすんなりと出てくるあたり、諸々な場所に目を瞑れば良い上司なのであろう。\r\n\r\n「さて、任務は終わった。俺は璃月に戻るとするが旅人、お前は次はどこへ行くんだ？」\r\n「一度モンドへ帰る。向こうでもまだ終えていない任務があるから…」\r\n「ふむ、モンドか…」\r\n「俺も鍾離先生と一緒に帰るとするよ。モンドに帰るのなら相棒とは暫くさようならだ」\r\n\r\n何かを考えるように顎に手を添えている鍾離と手を振るタルタリヤを横目に空は新たな任務へ向かうべく一歩踏み出そうとした、その時。\r\n\r\n「待て、旅人」\r\n「？」\r\n「公子殿を連れていってくれないか？」\r\n「…は？」\r\n\r\n暫く黙り込んでいたかと思えば突然の鍾離の発言にタルタリヤと空は呆気を取られる。先程まで鍾離と共に璃月に戻り、二人で甘い時間を過ごそうと密かに意気揚々としていたタルタリヤの気分は一気に谷底へと突き落とされた。\r\n\r\n「…鍾離先生？何故、俺が相棒とモンドに行かなきゃならないのかな？」\r\n「先の通り、旅人は無茶をしかねない。道中は長いだろう。護衛ついでに書類を届けて欲しい」\r\n「待って先生、相棒はそんなに弱くはないと思うし…俺じゃなくて相棒に預ければいい話じゃないかな…？」\r\n「これは往生堂の大切な書類であり北国銀行の件も少々関わっている。俺が璃月から離れるには少々面倒だし、公子殿にしか頼めない」\r\n「ここからモンドまで片道丸二日はかかるんだ、滞在も含めれば一週間は会えないんだけど！」\r\n\r\n普段はあまり感情が上下しないタルタリヤだが、恋人とこれからゆっくりとした時間を過ごせると意気込んでいただけに、その恋人からの無茶な提案と勝手振りに思わず声を上げてしまった。鍾離はというと、そんなタルタリヤの気持ちなど知ってか知らずかいつも通りの涼しげな顔で目の前の相手を見つめている。二人の痴話喧嘩とも取れるやり取りを間で見ながら、始まった…と空は頭を抱えて溜息を溢した。\r\n\r\n「後程往生堂へ寄ってくれ。書類は渡守が手渡してくれるだろう。では、俺は一足先に璃月へ戻らせてもらう」\r\n「ちょっ…鍾離先生…鍾離先生！？」\r\n\r\n後ろで一束に纏めた髪を優雅に揺らし、鍾離は颯爽とその場から姿を消してしまった。タルタリヤの悲痛な叫びも虚しく空気へ消え、肩をがっくりと落として深く息を吐いた。\r\n\r\n「公子…どんまい」\r\n「こいつ…本当に可哀想な奴だな…」\r\n\r\n空と、どこからともなくひょっこりと現れたパイモンに慰められつつ、その後言われた通り往生堂へ行き書類を預かったタルタリヤは不服ながらもきちんと任務を果たすべく空たちと共にモンドへ向かうこととなった。\r\nそして、それは同時にタルタリヤにとって地獄のような日々の始まりでもあったのだ。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n――――――――――\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n璃月からモンドまでの道のりは長い。\r\n流通には馬車などが使用され荷物が運搬されるが冒険者はそんな贅沢なものを使えるわけがなく、空たちは己の足でひたすら歩みを進めるしかなかった。幸いにも鍛えているおかげか体力には恵まれているが、戦闘後ろくに休む間もなくモンドへと旅立ったので、いくら空たちといえど体力は限界に近かった。\r\n\r\n「空〜…オイラ疲れたぞ…」\r\n「さすがに俺も…」\r\n「ははっ、君たちの限界はその程度なのかな」\r\n「こいつ、腹立つな…」\r\n\r\nあれから半日近く歩いただろうか。太陽はすっかり顔を隠し代わりに満月が夜空を支配し、高い位置から彼らを見下ろしていた。\r\n\r\n「ほら相棒、あそこに望舒旅館が見える。今日は戦闘もして体力がさすがに持たない。今夜は宿泊し、明日に備えるのが得策だと思うよ」\r\n「美味いものは食べれるか！？」\r\n「勿論」\r\n「やったー！ごっはん！ごっはんー！」\r\n\r\n食べ物のこととなると途端に疲れなど吹き飛んでしまうパイモンはキラキラと輝きを描いて跳ね上がり喜んだ。そんな賑やかな空気と裏腹に、表向きは笑顔を向けていたタルタリヤは非常に複雑な思いを抱えながら空たちと共に望舒旅館へと向かった。\r\n夕食の時間にしては少々遅い時間のため、食事処はそこまで混み合っておらず、旅館について部屋を確保してからパイモンにせがまれ急ぎ食事をした彼らは早朝に出発するべく早々に各々部屋へと戻っていった。\r\n\r\n部屋につくなり、服もそのまま、既に敷かれてある布団に身を投げたタルタリヤは月明かりがよく見える大きな窓に顔を向け、思う。\r\n\r\n（綺麗だ…ああ、そういえば、先生を初めて抱いたときもこんな夜だったっけ）\r\n\r\n思い返すは恋人のことばかり。\r\nまだ別れて一日も経っていないというのに過去の記憶から彼を辿り会おうとしてしまう。初めての情事を思い出すと下半身が疼いて仕方がないが、同時に虚しさも溢れてきてタルタリヤは考えることをやめた。\r\n目を瞑り、布団へ顔を埋める。勝手なことでいつもこう自分を振り回す鍾離。こんなにも身体の奥底から愛おしさが溢れて仕方がないのに一週間も耐えられるのだろうか。\r\n戻ったら手酷く抱いてやると考えながら、タルタリヤは布団の温もりに意識を預け、そのまま手放した。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n――――――――――\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n結局、空とパイモンとタルタリヤがモンドに着いたのはあれから二日後のことであった。道中にいるヒルチャールやスライム、険しい道を辿りひたすら走り続け、モンドへ着く頃には身も精神も疲労困憊の状態で気力だけで立っているようなものだった。しかしそれは空とパイモンだけで、タルタリヤはあまり疲れた様子はなく、むしろ退屈そうな顔を一瞬したのを空は見逃していない。\r\n\r\n「はあ…とんだ災難だった。相棒はこれから任務かい？」\r\n「うん、でもさすがに今日は一度休む」\r\n「その方がいい。命ギリギリの戦いというのは非常に楽しいものがあるが、君にそんなつまらない奴らにやられて欲しくはないからね」\r\n\r\n聞こえはどうであれ、これはタルタリヤの優しさであり戦好き故の経験から来る助言と空を一人の冒険者として認めていてのことだ。モンド城の門の前でそう話したあと、タルタリヤは空たちは別れ、頼まれた書類を冒険者協会のキャサリンへと手渡した。\r\n\r\n「はい、確かに承りました」\r\n「宜しく頼むよ」\r\n\r\n書類の内容は勿論知ることはないが、鍾離からの任務をこなしたタルタリヤは悩んでいた。今から璃月に戻ってもいいがさすがに今からまた歩くとなるとあまりの距離の遠さにげんなりしてしまう。鍾離に早く会って無茶苦茶にしてやりたい気持ちは山々だが、彼はひとまずせっかくモンドへ来たのだから手土産の一つでも買っていってやるか、と結局モンドでの宿泊を心に決めて闇に染まる街に溶け込んでいった。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n――――――――――\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nモンドから璃月に戻ったタルタリヤを待ち受けていたものは、離れていた間に溜まっていたファデュイとしての大量の仕事であった。鍾離と最後に顔を合わせた五日後のことである。きちんと書類を届けたとの報告を往生堂に伝えに行くついでに鍾離へ手土産と文句を投げつけようとしたのだが、肝心の鍾離はおらずまたどこかへ散歩しに行ってしまったと渡守から伝えられ、更にタルタリヤの腹の底に欲望と苛立ちが溜まっていく。会いたくても会えない、そんなストレスをぶつけるように仕事に明け暮れた。\r\n\r\n「公子様…なんだかお疲れの様子ですね」\r\n「疲れというより…苛ついているのでは」\r\n\r\n北国銀行内に勤める部下たちから見てもどんよりとした空気がタルタリヤに纏わり付いているのがわかるらしく、こんな会話がこそこそと繰り広げられるようにまでなっていた。ファトゥス執行官は曲者揃いで逆鱗に触れたらどうなるかは彼らが一番良く知っている。どうにかこれ以上タルタリヤを怒らせまいと細心の注意を払いながら、受付嬢のエカテリーナは控えめにタルタリヤの部屋の扉を叩いた。\r\n\r\n「公子様、お時間宜しいでしょうか？」\r\n「何、入って」\r\n「失礼致します」\r\n\r\n静かに扉を開けて部屋へ足を踏み入れると、げんなりしているのか苛ついているのか、黙々と険しい顔で書類と向き合っているタルタリヤがいた。エカテリーナへ一切の視線を向けることもなく短く低めの声で返事を返したタルタリヤの側まで近付き、可能な限り要点だけ話して退散した方が良さそうだとエカテリーナは判断した。これは相当根を詰めているらしい。\r\n\r\n「先日の結果と報告書です」\r\n「あぁ…うん、そこに置いておいて。あと俺はこれから所用で外に出てくる。宜しくね」\r\n「かしこまりました」　\r\n\r\n浅く頭を下げ、エカテリーナはそっと部屋から出ていった。閉められた扉の前で困った上司だと心で呟き、それを言葉に出せない代わりに溜息を小さくついて自分の仕事場へと戻っていった。\r\n心配されている中心人物であるタルタリヤはというと、エカテリーナが出ていったのを扉の音で確認したあと、深く溜息をついていた。椅子の背もたれに思い切り身体を預け天井を見上げて目を瞑る。\r\n\r\n（これを乗り切れば会いに行けるかな）\r\n\r\nそもそもタルタリヤがこれだけ仕事に追われる羽目になったのも全てタルタリヤが今最も会いたい人物のせいであるが、それを咎めようという気は彼にはなく、咎めるよりももっと別の意味で返して貰おうという気持ちが大きい。今これだけ仕事をこなせるのも、落ち着いたらすぐに鍾離に会いに行くという希望があってのことだ。\r\n毎回約束を結ぶわけではない。大体はタルタリヤが鍾離に会いに行くことが多く、それも一か八かの賭けのようなもの。恋仲になってから、タルタリヤが来ることを予想してか鍾離も往生堂にいることが多い気はするが。\r\n\r\n「…先生は、会いには来てくれやしないよ」\r\n\r\n鍾離の性格を分かっていてそれが面白く付き合っているのも自分でよくわかっている。それでもどうしても募っていく煩わしさを言葉にして吐き出さなければ気が済まない。誰に聞かれるわけもなく、空気へ溶け込み消えていくのだから。\r\nとん、と紙の束を纏め部屋を後にする。北国銀行から外へ出れば嫌味な程明るく澄み渡る青い空が広がっていた。太陽の眩しさについ目を細める。と、その何メートルか先にある璃月の大きな石段の上に掛かっている赤い橋の上を歩く見慣れた人物。\r\n\r\n「…！」\r\n\r\n優雅に髪を揺らし凛とした姿勢で歩く。遠目から見てもわかる高貴さと威厳のある雰囲気。\r\n\r\n「鍾離先生…」\r\n\r\nタルタリヤは視線も外さずに無意識に走り出そうとした。彼に意識を飛ばし北国銀行の扉が開いた音も聞こえず、後ろから声がかかるまでは。\r\n\r\n「公子様、あの…」\r\n「…何？」\r\n\r\n今自分がどんな顔をしているかはわからないが、きっと声をかけてきた彼女が青ざめる程なのだろうとタルタリヤは瞬時に理解し、久しぶりの恋人へ駆け寄ろうとしたところに入った邪魔への殺意を直ぐに消した。慌てて笑顔を向けて鍾離を背にし彼女へ向き合う。さっさと要件だけ聞いて追いかければいいだけなのだから。\r\n\r\n「あの…大変申し上げ難いのですが…」\r\n「うん、何？」\r\n「実は…」\r\n「兄ちゃん！！」\r\n「！」\r\n\r\n突然身体に小さな衝撃が来たかと思うと、下を見下ろせばそこには自分とほのかに似た可愛い弟が抱きついているではないか。何故またテウセルがここに、と聞く前に彼女がテウセル様がまたどうしても会いたいとスネージナヤから船へ乗って来たと説明をしてくれた。\r\n\r\n「今度は一人で来てないよ！ちゃんと許可を貰って兄ちゃんに会いに来たんだ！」\r\n「ああそうだったのかテウセル、会えて嬉しいよ」\r\n「…？兄ちゃん、何だか疲れてる？」\r\n「そんなことないよ、兄ちゃんはテウセルに会えて疲れすら吹き飛んでしまったさ」\r\n\r\nタルタリヤはめいっぱいの笑顔で可愛い弟を抱き上げる。タルタリヤの中で自分の家族は最優先だが、ちらと後ろを振り向いてみても、もう鍾離の姿はそこにはなかった。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n――――――――――\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n「ふう…」\r\n　\r\nちゃぷ、と部屋に備えられている風呂場でタルタリヤは湯に浸かりながら頭を抱えた。流石にこのタイミングで家族の訪問など誰が予想しただろうか。\r\nそのテウセルはというと、兄ちゃんと一緒に寝ると騒いで譲ろうとしなかったので、先程まで共にベッドへ入り寝かしつけてきたのでぐっすりと夢の中にいる。\r\nやっと仕事面で片付いたと思った矢先に家族の訪問。余程神から嫌われているらしい。\r\n\r\n「そしてこれも、仕方がないことか…」\r\n\r\n疲労が蓄積すると人間は本能で生殖しようとしてしまう生き物。そしてそんな時に五日ぶりに遠目からとはいえ恋人の姿を見てしまったのだ。下半身が自分の意思と反して大きく勃起しているのは、仕方がない。\r\n\r\n「…んっ…ぁ…」\r\n\r\n水面下でそっと自分の手で握る。勿論脳内で今日見た鍾離の背中を思い出しながら。あのかっちりと着こなされた服の下の素肌を自分だけは知っている。じっくりと脱がせて、中途半端に服をはぎ取って露わになった鍾離の背に赤い痕を残すのが堪らないのだ。そう思考を巡らせてしまえばタルタリヤはもう止まれない。\r\n\r\n「はっ…はっ…ぅ…ん…っ…ぁ…」\r\n\r\nゆっくりと根本から先端まで上下に擦っていた手の動きが自然と速くなる。先端の部分だけを手のひら全体で包むようにして擦ると、無意識に跳ねる腰のせいでお湯も弾けて音を立てた。\r\n気持ち良い、気持ち良いのに虚しい。彼の中はもっと、と考えるだけで達してしまいそうになる。でもそれも、今は空想。\r\n\r\n「ぁ…っ…！っ…せん、せ…ぅ…！……んっ…ぅぅ！」\r\n\r\n好きで好きで堪らない。触れたい。\r\n溢れてしまった気持ちはもう戻ることはなく無我夢中で陰茎を慰めることでその気持ちをどうにかしようとして、息を殺してタルタリヤは湯の中で欲を吐き出した。\r\n\r\n「はっ……ぁ………はっ………」\r\n\r\n浮かぶ大量の白い欲を見ながら、タルタリヤは静かに笑って項垂れた。\r\n\r\n「…はは……会いたいな…」\r\n\r\n哀れな猛犬が明けぬ夜で泣いている。タルタリヤが涙を流さぬ代わりに天井に付着した雫が一粒、切なく床へとこぼれ落ちた。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n――――――――――\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nテウセルが璃月に来て四日が経った。幸いにも、タルタリヤにとって弟という存在が恋人と会えない苦痛を忘れさせてくれる。それでも毎日夜が来て、テウセルが隣で眠り一人になる度に虚しさに襲われて、タルタリヤは限界寸前であった。\r\n\r\n「兄ちゃん！僕、あの石が欲しい！」\r\n「……」\r\n「兄ちゃん？」\r\n「ん？あぁ、ごめんねテウセル。なんだっけ、石？」\r\n「うん！ほら見て！あそこに並んでる石！キラキラしてて綺麗だよ！トーニャお姉ちゃんに見せてあげたい！」\r\n\r\n璃月の露店が並ぶ道を歩いているとテウセルがタルタリヤの手を引っ張ってそこへ連れて行く。一瞬上の空だったことを誤魔化してテウセルの思うがままについていくと、夜泊石や石珀がずらりと並んでいる店の前で立ち止まった。\r\n\r\n「いらっしゃい！」\r\n「うわぁ…！」\r\n\r\n近くでより光る石たちにどれにしようか迷っているのか輝きに喜んでいるのか、テウセルは並べてある石へ近付いて端から端まで何度も見渡している。\r\n\r\n「兄ちゃん！こっちの石と、それから、うんと、これも欲しい！」\r\n「うん、いいよ。テウセルが欲しいのなら兄ちゃんが全部買ってあげよう」\r\n「本当！？」\r\n\r\n笑顔で飛び上がり選ぶテウセルの姿を見て、甘やかしすぎかとも思うがあの笑顔を見られるのならとつい微笑んでしまう。と、そこへ、横からふと二人の男女がテウセルの側へ近付いてきた。ふわ、と香る、鼻をかするよく知った匂い。\r\n\r\n「……鍾離せん……」\r\n「失礼。こちらの石珀を全て購入したいのだが…」\r\n「毎度あり！」\r\n「ええ！？」\r\n\r\nテウセルがどれを購入するか迷っていた矢先、そう言い放ったのは間違いなくタルタリヤの恋人―鍾離であった。後ろに連れているのは往生堂の渡し守だ。こちらに気付いていないのか見向きもせず商人と購入の手続きをしている渡し守の側で石を見えている鍾離へと駆け寄る。\r\n\r\n「鍾離先生！」\r\n「ん？公子殿か。こんなところで会うとは珍しいな」\r\n「いやそんな呑気な…」\r\n「兄ちゃん！僕が買おうとしてたのにこの人が全部買っちゃったんだ！」\r\n\r\nタルタリヤに泣きつきながらしがみつくテウセルの頭をそっと撫でつつ、タルタリヤは真っ先に会いたかったと言葉にしたいのをぐっと堪え、鍾離へ声をかけた。\r\n\r\n「あー…先生、実は俺の弟が石珀を何個か欲しがっているんだ。出来れば譲ってもらえないかな」\r\n「…ふむ、そうだったのか。それは気付かずに申し訳なかった。少年、それではこの石珀を持っていくといい。この中で一番品質がいいものだ」\r\n\r\nそう言って鍾離は二つの石珀をテウセルに差し出した。テウセルの視点からすれば元は自分のものを横取りしようとした悪い大人に見えているだろう。タルタリヤの後ろから警戒したように見ていたが、大好きな兄にそっと背中を押されて無言で石珀を受け取った。\r\n\r\n「テウセル、ありがとうは？」\r\n「その…ありがとう」\r\n「構わない。元はこちらが気付かなかった落ち度にある」\r\n「鍾離先生、こちらの支払いが完了致しました」\r\n「ふむ。では、次へ行くとしよう」\r\n\r\n商人と話していた渡守からそう声をかけられ、タルタリヤとテウセルと向き合っていた鍾離は踵を返しその場を離れようとする。久々に会ったというのにこんなあっさりした態度を取られて一瞬唖然としてしまったタルタリヤだが、その背中をすぐに追いかけると腕をぐっと掴み鍾離の耳元で小声で囁いた。\r\n\r\n「明日の夜、往生堂の前で待ってて」\r\n\r\nきっと余裕がない声だ。さすがの鍾離も何が行われるかなんて理解しているに決まっている。そう言われた鍾離は、タルタリヤへ目を細めて静かに微笑みそれを返事とした。\r\nタルタリヤが鍾離に勝手な任務を課せられてから九日目。長い夜明けへのカウントダウンがすぐそこまで迫っていた。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n――――――――――\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n「お待たせ、先生」\r\n\r\n十日目、璃月全体が灯りに溢れた夜。鍾離は約束通り往生堂の前に佇んでいた。短く返事をして歩き始めるタルタリヤの後を着いていく。\r\n\r\n「何処へ？」\r\n「愚問だよ」\r\n\r\n繁華街から少し離れた場所へ進んでいく。真っ直ぐと、大きな紅葉が彩る橋を渡ると宿泊場が見えた。二人は無言でそこへ入り、タルタリヤが受付を済ませると一番上の階の端の部屋へと案内された。\r\n部屋の扉を開けると広さは充分にあったが、中央に大きなベッドが堂々と設置してあり、それが\"そういう目的の宿泊施設\"ということを自覚させる。\r\n部屋の内装に気を取られていると、扉を閉めたタルタリヤが勢い良く鍾離の背中を押しつけ、性急に口へ噛み付いた。何が起きたのか一瞬理解できなかった鍾離はタルタリヤのされるがままに口付けを受け入れるしかない。\r\n\r\n「っ…！ぅ…は…」\r\n「んっ………ぁ……」\r\n\r\n猛獣に食べられる前の味見。ぬるりと舌が侵入し、口内の全てを舐め取られる。唾液が自分で止められなくて、端からだらしなく溢して、そうして互いを高めあって、堕ちていく。\r\n\r\n「…っ…はあ……」\r\n「今日は、随分と急ぐな…」\r\n「当たり前だよ…何日我慢してたと思ってたの？」\r\n\r\n口を離したかと思えばひょいと軽々と、さも当然のように鍾離を抱え、すたすたとベッドへ歩いていく。キングサイズのそれの真ん中に抱えていた鍾離を横たわらせると、逃さないようにとすぐさま上にのしかかった。\r\n\r\n「はぁ…俺をモンドに行かせて、そのあと戻ってきたら仕事に追われた挙句にテウセルの訪問…鍾離先生と十日ぶりに会ったんだよ？我慢なんて出来ると思うの？」\r\n「十日？ああ、あれからもうそんな時間が経っていたのか。二日くらいだと思っていたぞ」\r\n「ふつ…っ！？」\r\n\r\nタルタリヤは鍾離の時間感覚が常人とかけ離れていることをすっかり忘れていた。思い返せば鍾離が料理を作ると言い出して八時間かけていた過去がある。長年生きてきた彼にとって、もうどれだけの時間が経つかなど、そこまで気にしていないのだ。\r\n\r\n「もう十日だよ。俺がどれだけ会いたかったのか、先生は知らないでしょ」\r\n\r\n―もう、抑えなんて効かないから\r\nみっともないと笑われてもいい。余裕がない男だと思われてもいい。そんなことなんてどうでもいいから、早く彼に触れたい。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n――――――――――\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n「ん………ぅ………」\r\n\r\n閉じられたカーテンの隙間から入り込む太陽の光に照らされて、タルタリヤは薄く目を開いた。結局何時間抱いたかわからないが途中から鍾離は気絶し、一人でする後始末が大変だったくらいには激しい一夜を過ごしたことは確かである。抱きしめている恋人の背中が鼻先にあって、赤い跡や歯型が行為の激しさを物語っていた。\r\n\r\n（この背中…テウセルが来た日に見かけたときから口付けたくて堪らなかったな…）\r\n\r\nそのときは想像だったけれど。\r\n実物を確かめるように跡の上に優しく優しく唇を落とす。すると、鍾離がもぞ、と動き目を覚ました。\r\n\r\n「ん…」\r\n「…先生、おはよう」\r\n「……あぁ…」\r\n「昨晩は楽しかったね」\r\n「はぁ…お陰で腰が使い物にならなくなった…」\r\n「いいじゃないか…今日も散歩をするだけでしょ？」\r\n「…俺も若くはないから…手加減というものをしてはもらえないか」\r\n「今回は鍾離先生が俺をモンドに勝手に行かせたせいだから自業自得だよ」\r\n「その後は俺のせいではないが…」\r\n\r\nふふ、と笑うタルタリヤに反して鍾離は少々眉を寄せて不機嫌そうにした。ぎゅ、と抱きしめる力を強くしてタルタリヤは鍾離の髪へそっと唇を落とした。\r\n\r\n「これに懲りたらもう俺を離さないように努力しなよ、鍾離先生」\r\n「…はぁ、こんな目に合うのはもう懲り懲りだ…」\r\n\r\nあんなに気持ち良さそうに喘いでたのに、と耳元で囁くと肘で腹部を殴られた。鍾離は全身に痛みを感じながら、もう二度とタルタリヤにお使いなど頼まないと強く心に決めたのだった。\r\n夜は明け、朝日がやってきたが、二人は未だベッドの中から動くことはなく、陽の光に包まれて幸せそうに笑いあっていた。',

INSERT INTO `sueed_article` VALUES ('8', 'Fire in Midwinter', 'Once a year, every alpha goes into rut. Diluc usually spends his ruts by himself, hating every second of it. This time around, though, Kaeya has a better idea...', 'Diluc knew that something was wrong the moment that Adelinde brought him a pot of coffee. Her hands were shaking as she poured it, and while he watched with a frown, he saw that her chest was not moving with breaths. Concerned, he asked, “Is something wrong?”\r\n\r\nShe set down the pot and shook her head. Subtly, she steadied herself with a hand on the back of one of the empty chairs at the dining table. “No, Master Diluc, it’s just that—”\r\n\r\nBefore she could finish, one of the younger maids entered from outside. Diluc glanced over to greet her, but as soon as their gazes met and she was on the verge of greeting him with a smile, her eyes widened. She paled and promptly fainted, as if just inhaling had make her become so dizzy. Realization struck him and he stood from the table, hastening to say, “Archons, I’m sorry, Adelinde. I— I’ll go upstairs. You can take the day off.” He didn’t wait to watch her nod before going up the stairs to his bedroom and locking himself inside. Shit. His rut, already?\r\n\r\nHe looked across the room at the calendar and nearly hit his head against the wall— he had thought it was Thursday today, not Friday. There had been so much work to do around the winery lately. So much paperwork and so many late nights that he had lost track of the day.\r\n\r\nWell, there would be no working for the next twenty-four hours, it seemed. He lay down on his bed and ignored his erection as soon as it started to make his pants tighter. It was useless to masturbate, and he didn’t feel desperate yet.\r\n\r\nIf he had a mate, he would be less calm about his rut, because then he would be worried about half-killing them. He knew that his instincts as an alpha were terrifying, because he had nearly killed Kaeya once when he had tried to hold his hand during a rut. Smelling another alpha’s scent during that time had made him go completely ballistic. The last time he had been in so much pain that Adelinde had brought an omega. Diluc had needed to tell her to tie him to the bed and put a bit between his teeth. He had totally forgotten the day as soon as he woke up, but she was unscathed and he had bruises from the silk ties around his wrists. Clearly, he had struggled.\r\n\r\nDiluc sighed and wiped his face with both hands. It was fine. Once a year. One day to just get wiped out of his head. It was depressing to know that he had a pheromone disorder and that he would lose so many days of his life to unsatisfied sexual desire.\r\n\r\nThe only person he wanted to have sex with was Kaeya, but it wasn’t as if he could help now.\r\nHalf of his lust-addled brain was thinking, Archons, I want Kaeya, and the other half of his brain was thinking, I want an omega. He shoved down the second, background thought and closed his eyes. He repeated Kaeya’s name over and over in his head in an attempt to take his mind off the throbbing sensation in his crotch. He unzipped his pants, then put his hands behind his head and kept on lying there.\r\n\r\nRestraint, he told himself. Father admired my restraint above all else.\r\nHe felt sweat start to pour down his spine as his cock twitched and his fangs grew. They started to secrete liquid pheromones into his mouth. Forcibly, he retracted them.\r\n\r\nFuck, fuck, fuck.\r\n\r\nHow many minutes had passed? He checked his pocket watch and nearly cried.\r\n\r\nOnly thirty minutes since he had hit the mattress? Twenty-four hours more of feeling like his testicles were going to explode? It hurt indescribably. It seemed that every time it happened, he forgot the pain as soon as he was cured of it. It hurts like this every time, he told himself, not reassuringly. Be a man.\r\nStill, he was restless and upset. At least omegas just felt lusty and overheated. Sure, they lost their minds, but it wasn’t as if they were at risk of ripping their partner’s throat out or having a refractory period of about five seconds for twenty-four hours. Outside of rut, it was bad enough. The average alpha had a refractory period of two minutes, compared to male betas at roughly fifteen minutes.\r\nDiluc took off his shirt because it was too hot, and his socks. He left his pants on in an effort to dissuade himself from succumbing to pointless masturbation. It wouldn’t be nearly enough to get him to release. And if it was enough, from experience he knew that it would be even harder to do it again. When he had experimented with it, he had ejaculated a maximum of twenty times during a rut when he was eighteen, five years ago. Thinking about it… now, fifteen was a more realistic number considering how overworked he was. He wet his lips and resisted the temptation to touch himself.\r\nFinally, an hour later, he lost his mind.\r\n\r\nHe started to stroke himself, turning over to hold himself up on his knees and his left elbow. The air became thin. He breathed through his mouth, and liquid pheromones dripped along with saliva onto the bedsheets. Come on, he thought, squeezing his eyes shut against the pulsating pain in his lower stomach, just come already, you stupid—\r\n\r\n“Diluc.” The sound of his name, that silvery voice— it was accompanied by a scent of fine wine and frost. Diluc’s eyes widened and fear shuddered over his body. He let go of himself and pushed his nose against the sheets wet with his pheromones, to block out Kaeya’s scent. The last time this had happened— he remembered Kaeya’s throat under his hands, his eyes glazed over. No, no—\r\nKaeya’s voice cut off his thoughts. “It’s worse than usual, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nHe managed to speak rationally. “Get out. I don’t want to hurt you.”\r\n\r\n“It’s okay,” he said, and Diluc could hear him walking closer. “I came prepared.” Before Diluc could protest more, Kaeya sat down on the edge of the bed and ran his hand through Diluc’s hair. His fingers were cool and pleasant, but his scent was permeating through the sheets. Diluc felt his fangs lengthening further, his blood getting hotter. Gently, Kaeya said, “Lift your face, Luc.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and did not.\r\n\r\nKaeya was silent and still for a moment, but it did not last too long.\r\n\r\nThe next thing Diluc knew, his hair was being pushed away from his nape, and Kaeya licked across his scent gland. His whole body protested as Kaeya’s fangs left a trail of pheromones against his skin. Before he could register what was happening, he opened his eyes to the sight of Kaeya underneath him as he wrapped his hands around his throat, growling.\r\n\r\nHe was going to kill the alpha that dared to insult him—\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Kaeya lifted his hand from the bed, pressing it against Diluc’s nose and mouth— a cloth. A soft cloth that smelled like an omega, like vanilla and lavender and cloying sweetness. His head spun. His thoughts shifted from I’ll kill you to I want to fuck you.\r\n\r\nAs Diluc started to pull off Kaeya’s pants, not quite aware of himself, Kaeya chuckled. “I’m not an omega, you know,” he said coyly. Kaeya touched his cock, but not with enough insistence for it to feel like anything aside from cruel teasing. “It makes me a little sad that you’re enjoying this random perfume but not my own scent.” Diluc kept on pulling off his pants as he rutted against the palm of Kaeya’s calloused hand.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Luc. I love you.”\r\n\r\nThe words startled him. Huh? My omega loves me? He looked down, his head a little bit clearer, but he corrected himself. No, Kaeya. Alpha. For a moment, he stared down at Kaeya, who smiled up at him with a bit of mischief. Then, he pressed his brow against Kaeya’s collarbones and said, “I’m sorry.” His mind was sluggish and he felt too hot to breathe, but his throat was tight. I hate this. I hate this so much. The scent from the cloth was still making his cock drip precum between them. “I’m so sorry.”\r\n“Hmm? No, don’t apologize,” he said, kissing Diluc’s cheek, careful not to let his fangs touch. “I’ll get rid of the cloth in a moment. I just need you to calm down first, so that’s why I brought it. I’m not upset, or anything.” His hand was shaking, and Diluc was filled with concern. Kaeya saw the direction of his gaze and smiled. “Your pheromones are so strong when you’re in rut. My alpha must think that you’re about to kill me. Oh, but don’t worry. I’m not scared.”\r\n\r\nDiluc had enough of his wits about him to ask, “What are you planning?”\r\n\r\n“Sex. What else?” A playful little grin. “Or shall I call it ‘lovemaking?’”\r\n\r\nHe frowned, still breathing lungful after lungful of the pheromone perfume. “How?”\r\n\r\n“Like this,” Kaeya said, and swiftly flipped them over. He continued to hold the cloth to Diluc’s nose until they settled. After a moment, Kaeya untied his dark, silky hair and pulled off his eyepatch, revealing the glass eye beneath.\r\n\r\nNo matter how hard he tried to, Diluc could not stop his gaze from lingering as he remembered what Kaeya had said to him then. It was in a fit of anger during one of their arguments about his being a spy, and thus untrustworthy as a Knight of Favonius. Kaeya had pulled off his eyepatch and said, They used to see through my eye. I carved it out myself as soon as I joined the Knights. It wasn’t an injury. What more do I need to do for you to trust me again?\r\n\r\nKaeya’s voice brought him away from the memory, back to the cloying omega pheromones. He was asking, “Could you hold the cloth yourself a bit?”\r\n\r\nDiluc nodded. Kaeya picked up a satchel he had dropped on the floor and emptied it on the bed. Diluc felt his eyes widen. Padded restraints and a strange leather strap with a metal ring in the centre. As Diluc pressed the cloth against his nose and his cock throbbed intolerably, Kaeya pulled off his trousers.\r\n\r\nDiluc watched Kaeya bind each of his ankles to opposite bedposts. The padded shackles were on chains that looked like they would pull taut if he tried to close his legs. Diluc knew that Kaeya was going to try to put it in, since that was how they usually had sex, but he was almost certain that it wouldn’t go smoothly. Next, Kaeya lifted the cloth from his nose and cuffed his wrists together, attaching the chain to the headboard.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the shackles clicked, the omega scent was gone, and the only thing left was Kaeya’s scent. It was tainted with the musk of an alpha’s arousal, suffocating and painful to inhale. While he tried to tell Kaeya to put the cloth back over his nose, Kaeya used that weird metal ring to prop his mouth open. He fastened the strap behind Diluc’s head and explained as he pulled off his shirt. “I’m sorry. Your fangs are dripping and I don’t want you to bite yourself. If you’re not okay, flatten one of your palms against the bed and I’ll stop.”\r\n\r\nThere was no clear way to reply except to close his hands into fists. Kaeya kissed his brow. The movement made his scent gland closer to Diluc’s face, and his whole body jolted.\r\n\r\nHe needed to get away.\r\n\r\nThe chains all pulled taut at the same time as he writhed away from Kaeya. His inner alpha controlled his body while he was overwhelmed with guilt for trying to push his beloved away. Kaeya kissed his nose, his cheek, and the corner of his mouth. He pulled away with a sigh. “I want to kiss you.”\r\n\r\nWell, they would probably shred each other’s tongues if they kissed, so it was understandable to Diluc that they could not. After he overcame his disappointment, Kaeya kissed Diluc’s scent gland, then rubbed his nose against it. His voice was strained and edged with fear when he spoke. “I need to bite you or you’ll keep on releasing pheromones. I won’t be able to get it up.”\r\n\r\nDiluc looked down and saw that while he was painfully erect, Kaeya was not. He tipped his head to the side in a silent invitation. Kaeya licked his skin a few times before sinking his fangs in.\r\n\r\nHis mind whitened. It was pure agony.\r\n\r\nHis body was shaking, the chains were rattling, and his erection was going down. Another alpha’s pheromones flooding his scent gland— it was something that could only happen after losing a fight over territory, not something that happened during sex. It hurts.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t know when he started to cry, but he could feel hot tears on his cheeks when Kaeya’s fangs withdrew. Kaeya lapped them up with kisses, saying, “I’m sorry, Luc. It’ll feel better soon.”\r\n\r\nIt was true that the smell of Kaeya’s pheromones no longer felt like breathing in fire and acid. However, he was concerned about the fact that he had felt himself become flaccid. When he glanced down, Kaeya followed his gaze with a hand. It took only three strokes before it returned to how it had been before. Right, he thought bitterly. No miracles like pheromone-induced erectile dysfunction are going to happen during an alpha’s rut.\r\n\r\nHe felt a bit restless, though… covered in an alpha’s scent in the middle of his rut, unable to bite anything even though his fangs were discharging pheromones. Diluc watched with anxiety as Kaeya stroked him. After a minute, Kaeya said, “You’re not going to be able to come without knotting.” A pause, and he sat back on his knees with a look of contemplation. “I can’t make you knot on my own.”\r\nHis gaze travelled back to the omega-scented cloth. He put it under Diluc’s nose again before bending over and taking Diluc into his mouth. His eyes widened as he stared up at the canopy of the bed. When he tried to stop Kaeya, before he could wind up with a knot in his mouth, the chains held his legs spread wide. Then there was the touch of Kaeya’s pheromones on his cock.\r\n\r\nElectricity arced up his spine. Oh, Archons, Diluc thought, as he was enveloped by a wet, tight heat. Kaeya’s saliva was mixed with his liquid pheromones. Having been subdued by the same alpha that was sucking him off, Diluc’s body could only jolt while it was conscious of a different situation than his own. His body thought that there was an omega in the room while an alpha took him. He tried to resist Kaeya with every fibre in his body, but the chains were strong and Kaeya’s grip on his thighs was bruising. And, he was so good with his mouth that it was hard not to want more.\r\n\r\nThe harsher his breathing got, the more of the omega’s scent he inhaled, and the more the ache in his gut intensified. He could feel his knot swelling between Kaeya’s lips. Kaeya pulled off and kept on stroking him until his knot stopped growing. Then, looking satisfied, Kaeya tossed away the scented cloth and said, “Well done.” Diluc wanted to swear at him. He had been so overwhelmingly close.\r\nKaeya seemed to notice his desperation, chuckling as he poured oil into the palm of his right hand and slipped in one finger. Diluc’s breath caught. “Poor Luc. You were close, huh? Well, I’m not about to let you come while you sniff some random omega’s scent.” As he rubbed his fingertip against Diluc’s prostate, Diluc shut his eyes and tried not to moan. Still, with his mouth forcibly propped open, it was difficult not to make any embarrassing sounds. Kaeya slipped in another finger. “Do you know about bitching? When you turn an alpha into an omega by marking them and knotting them frequently?”\r\nHe did know about it, but it was impossible to achieve unless one had at least five alphas at their disposal to fuck the one who wanted to be an omega. The insemination was the most important part, but there was a limit to how much an alpha could spill outside of his rut.\r\n\r\nKaeya went on, “Well, I’m not really interested in trying it out, but I might knot you today.”\r\nDiluc felt his eyes widen. He tried to say, “What?” but he couldn’t form the word.\r\n\r\nHe chuckled as he put in the third finger and started to thrust them against Diluc’s prostate, making his breaths harsher and harsher. “Well, it’s turning me on that I can still make you spread your legs while you’re in rut.” With his other hand, Kaeya touched Diluc’s knot. “I mean, look at you. You’re the kind of alpha that any omega would want to be with in a rut. But your knot is out and your legs are open for another alpha.” Leaning down and licking Diluc’s scent gland, Kaeya added, “You’re mine, so let me knot you.” Diluc shuddered as Kaeya injected more liquid pheromones into his neck, more gently this time, licking the blood away. “Hmm, Luc? Please? If I knot you, don’t be upset.”\r\n\r\nDiluc relaxed his fingers and made fists again. Kaeya twined his tongue with Diluc’s, past the metal ring holding his mouth open. As Kaeya’s pheromones dripped onto his tongue, Diluc’s mind blanked again. His violent desire to fuck something was completely gone. He wanted Kaeya to pin him down and bite him more. Kaeya was the alpha who had defeated him, and he would serve him—\r\nHe shook himself. What was that primal thinking?\r\n\r\nDiluc closed his eyes and focused on the feeling when Kaeya’s fingers were replaced with his cock. He pushed in slowly and skilfully. When he was fully sheathed, Kaeya let out a pleased sigh. Diluc opened his eyes to see lust clouding Kaeya’s gaze as he pushed his hair out of his face, a bead of sweat rolling down his jaw. “I’m going to move.”\r\n\r\nDiluc nodded, and he started to thrust his hips. It was so good. But he wanted to be inside something— it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough. He started to moan, and he felt his cock weeping. Kaeya didn’t touch him, but kept on thrusting, hitting his prostate every time. The pleasure made little earthquakes on his spine every time their bodies connected, but his knot was cold.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the desperate whine that left his throat. Kaeya paused, blinked at him, then burst out with laughter. “Oh, Archons, that was cute. Do it again.”\r\n\r\nHe glared at Kaeya, who poked his nose. “Come on, Luc. Again.”\r\n\r\nWhen Diluc ignored him, Kaeya thrust deeper than every time before, and it ripped a moan from his throat. Kaeya kept on fucking him a little longer, until his knot throbbed again, and the high-pitched keening sound left his mouth again. Kaeya practically purred. “Oh, is your knot lonely?”\r\n\r\nWhen Kaeya wrapped his right hand around Diluc’s knot, his mind emptied. He moaned incoherently and continuously while warmth wrapped around his knot, triggering his ejaculation, while the feeling of being bred by an alpha stopped it. He was coming, but he couldn’t— tears poured down his face again. Kaeya’s hips rolled against his and the sounds of slapping skin filled the room. Just pull out for a moment, Diluc thought desperately, Just let me come.\r\n\r\nKaeya groaned, “Fuck, you’re so tight.”\r\n\r\nDiluc sobbed as waves of ruined orgasm washed over him, but his heart stopped when he felt something strain against the walls of his entrance. Kaeya started to rut his knot into Diluc. Pain choked him, and he gasped, his fingernails digging into his palms. When it was too swollen to pull out anymore, Kaeya’s thrusts became nudges, and it was only a second before Diluc felt him begin to come inside, his hot seed spilling. Before Diluc could try to beg for release, Kaeya said, out of breath, “Come, Diluc.”\r\nHis words were accompanied by an intensification of his pheromones. The command of the alpha who had dominated him wrenched his ejaculation out of him violently. As he came and screamed, Kaeya moaned softly, still pushing into him senselessly as he came and came and came. They had both knotted, so their ejaculations lasted for twenty minutes. Eventually, Diluc fell to the mattress, boneless, as so much semen spilled out of him that it was like urinating. Kaeya was shuddering on top of him, his arms having given out. Reaching up to pull out the metal ring in Diluc’s mouth, careful not to hit his fangs, Kaeya gasped, “I’m sorry. Your stomach is going to hurt.”\r\n\r\n“Then, take responsibility,” he breathed, as Kaeya freed his wrists. His body twitched every now and then. They lay there until their knots finally softened and went back to a normal size. Kaeya pulled out with a wet popping sound. Diluc laughed with disgust and amazement as he saw the fluids spilling out of him onto the once-pristine bedsheets. “You came a lot.”\r\n\r\nKaeya looked down at the mess on Diluc’s abdomen. “You came more. And you’re still hard.”\r\n\r\nDiluc shook his head, saying, “No more, not now.”\r\n\r\n“You know you’ll lose it again.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” he sighed, running his fingers through Kaeya’s hair. “But let’s wait until then.”\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence, before he agreed, “Sure, if that’s what you want.”\r\n\r\nThe two of them lay there for a while, sticky and exhausted. Diluc’s rut was somewhat subdued but far from over. At some point, Diluc told him, “Thanks.” Kaeya looked up, but didn’t lift his cheek from the inside of Diluc’s shoulder. “I always hate it when I sit here alone lusting after an omega.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled and kissed Diluc’s collarbones. “You know, I’ll roll over for you if you want, but maybe not when you’re in the middle of a rut.” Diluc laughed, and Kaeya moved a bit, lifting himself up onto his elbows. He rubbed his nose against Diluc’s scent gland. “You smell like me.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.”\r\n\r\n“Bite me,” he added, softly. “I can hardly smell your scent.”\r\n\r\nPushing his hair away from his neck, Kaeya turned enough that Diluc could bite the leftmost side of his nape. He felt his fangs release a copious amount of pheromones into his mouth, and said, “Either my rut is making my fangs drool like a teenager’s, or my alpha loves you as much as I do.”\r\n\r\nKaeya chuckled. “Which is it, I wonder?”\r\n\r\nDiluc opened his mouth and let his fangs sink into Kaeya’s scent gland. As soon as he did, his head throbbed and the feeling of his rut overpowering his brain returned. He pulled his mouth off Kaeya’s neck and said, “Ah, I think it’s coming back—”\r\n\r\n“I feel dizzy,” Kaeya said, laughing. It was a lightheaded sound. “Oh, Archons, your pheromones are so strong. ‘Disorder,’ huh?” Diluc bit him again, gently, and Kaeya groaned. Diluc felt him hardening against his thigh. “I must be perverted, getting turned on by a rutting alpha’s fangs in my neck.”\r\n\r\n“I must be, too.” He licked the new wounds on Kaeya’s neck and reached between them, wrapping both hands around himself and Kaeya. As soon as Kaeya started to move his hips, creating delicious friction between them, Diluc sighed, closing his eyes. “Shit, I think my knot is swelling.”\r\n\r\nKaeya sounded surprised. “I don’t think mine will anymore.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you can hold up until tomorrow,” Diluc said, capturing Kaeya’s lips with his.\r\n\r\nThey kissed passionately, open-mouthed. Their pheromones mixed in Diluc’s mouth and confused his alpha completely, until the lust his rut brought on lacked direction. Kaeya’s tongue explored the roof of his mouth and the ticklish feeling only aroused him, instead of annoying him as it usually did.\r\nHis fingers tangled in Kaeya’s hair, the gemstone in his earring cool to the touch. Kaeya’s hands roamed, thumbs moving over his nipples, palms sliding on his sides. The touches were full of confidence despite the gentle tremor that was probably caused by the pheromone confusion— he had marked Diluc, but Diluc had marked him, too, so who was the superior alpha?\r\n\r\nDiluc smiled against his mouth, and Kaeya smiled, too. They gave up on the deep kiss and opted for little pecks instead, as the tension between them mounted. Diluc felt close, but he didn’t want to release yet, not until he absorbed the high flush on Kaeya’s cheeks and the blissed-out look he always had when he came.\r\n\r\nSo, Diluc watched Kaeya’s face when he pulled away slightly, his breathing harsh as he thrust against Diluc, into his hands. His voice was low with desire, not as clear and silvery as usual. He let out a shuddering breath. “Diluc, I’m close.” He tightened his grasp slightly and Kaeya groaned, bowing his head. His hair fell into his face as his thrusts became erratic. “Diluc—”\r\n\r\nKaeya gasped as he came, his lashes fluttering, his lips swollen from their kiss. Diluc watched a moment longer, stroking him to completion. He fell forward, catching himself with one hand. Chuckling hoarsely, Kaeya said, “Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful— but it’s your rut we’re supposed to be dealing w— mmnf.”\r\n\r\nDiluc cut him off with a kiss. Kaeya didn’t protest more, and he placed his left hand on Diluc’s knot. With their hands both around his knot, he was about to climax again. As his body shuddered, Kaeya said against his mouth, “I think we’re getting pretty good at tricking your alpha.”\r\n\r\nHe grit his teeth as he came again, with a similarly unreasonable quantity of spend. He flinched every time Kaeya kissed him, every inch of his body oversensitive and tense. Kaeya sucked on his left nipple and his spine arched. “Wow,” he said, laughing. “You never react here. I should take advantage of your twenty-minute ejaculations, shouldn’t I?”\r\n\r\nArchons, his dick was already hurting. An omega’s pheromones acted like anesthetics during an alpha’s rut, but Diluc could only feel oversensitive. Every place where they touched was like getting an electroshock. He whimpered when Kaeya slipped one finger inside and stimulated his prostate. Kaeya grinned. “You sound like an omega. You’re so full of mine that you’re wet, too.”\r\n\r\n“Shut… up— argh!” Kaeya swept his thumb over the slit of Diluc’s still-spurting cock and he felt his eyes roll back in his head briefly. He felt like he was floating, out of his own body. Kaeya stimulated his nipples and prostate as if he was an omega. He was too sensitive. Everything hurt, but it was so pleasurable, too— he squirmed, trying to get Kaeya’s finger deeper. Maybe he could come harder and it would end faster.\r\n\r\nKaeya raised an eyebrow, looking up with his chin still on Diluc’s chest. “What’s the hurry?”\r\n\r\n“Fuck y—” Diluc gasped as Kaeya put in the second finger, starting to press and grind them against his prostate. His ejaculation stuttered, every orgasm like its own peak instead of continuous shuddering. Kaeya hissed between his teeth as Diluc’s fingernails scraped across his back.\r\n\r\nHe came harder when Kaeya bit his scent-gland again, while gripping his knot. His vision was blurry and his mind was hazy, but he could smell his own scent in front of his nose.\r\n\r\nMine.\r\n\r\nHe opened his mouth, biting Kaeya’s scent gland. As his pheromones spilled into Kaeya’s scent gland, Kaeya’s spilled into his. He felt drool dripping down his jaw and chin as he growled. Soon, Kaeya withdrew from his neck, continuing to fuck him with his fingers as Diluc’s fangs kept on leaking into his scent gland. It was useless to mark each other, really. As soon as the wounds were gone, their scents would be normal again, but his fangs were so itchy. Even his tongue felt too sensitive.\r\n\r\nHe was still coming. Kaeya said, a bit breathlessly, “You know, it is incredible to watch a knotting alpha come.” Diluc was too beyond himself to snap at him. “I mean, earlier I was coming, too, so I didn’t exactly realize, but it’s like you’re pissing yourself.” He ground his thumb into the slit and Diluc screamed, tearing away from Kaeya’s neck. “I mean, really…” Kaeya was grinding his thumb harder into the hypersensitive slit. Diluc’s whole body convulsed as he howled with pain and pleasure. “It won’t stop no matter what I do. Oh, what if I tried pheromone command?”\r\n\r\nDiluc managed to gasp out, “No, enough, your thumb—!”\r\n\r\nKaeya released copious amounts of his pheromones into the room, a stifling amount. With authority in his voice, he said, “Stop ejaculating.” Diluc’s body fell still and all of the shuddering stopped, but his cock was still leaking under Kaeya’s hand. He burst out with laughter, but his pheromones were still making Diluc’s body limp and pliant. “Wow, even that doesn’t work.”\r\n\r\nHe saw the clock from the corner of his eye. Ten minutes left of this ejaculation. He could only gasp and whine whenever Kaeya’s fingers pressed harder against his prostate or when he decided to torture the slit of Diluc’s cock a little bit. Kaeya asked, “Are you fucked-out, or are my pheromones too much? You’re not moving.”\r\n\r\n“Your… pheromones…” he managed. His vision was as blurry as if he were passing out.\r\n\r\nKaeya’s pheromones grew more intense. Frost and wine and alpha musk, crisp and intoxicating and overpowering. “Oh, that face. Archons. You’re so sexy.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t— breathe—”\r\n\r\n“No, no, don’t worry,” he cooed, kissing Diluc’s scent gland and making his blood rush with renewed heat. “The air is still there, you’re just feeling fuzzy in the head. It’ll be fun.”\r\n\r\nDiluc frowned a bit. “What? Fun?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” he said, with amusement in his voice. “A lot of fun.” Then, there was something in his mouth, and Kaeya ordered, “Retract your fangs and don’t bite. Relax and take it like an omega bitch.”\r\n\r\nBitching. The word resounded in his head. His alpha seemed to understand it and submit to it, even though Diluc knew that Kaeya didn’t want him to be an omega. Unconsciously, he spread his legs, but Kaeya was pushing into his mouth, so it was pointless. Kaeya noticed, though. “Oh, what’s this? You want me to make you into an omega bitch? It’s fine, I love you as you are.”\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t feel much, aside from Kaeya thrusting into his mouth in a way that sent sparks of pleasure down his spine. His mouth was sensitive as his cock while semen still spilled onto his abdomen impotently. He squirmed for friction, for Kaeya to knot him and actually do what he had promised.\r\n\r\nOh. He felt it in his throat and moaned around Kaeya. His scent gland was throbbing as Kaeya’s musk invaded his nostrils and his brain, numbing all of his thoughts. Submit to him, his alpha crooned in the back of his mind. He’s your prime alpha now. He owns you. You are his. He is yours.\r\n\r\nDiluc closed his eyes, ignoring that voice. Submission or no, the weird primalness of their sex would be gone by tomorrow. Either way, Kaeya wasn’t behaving differently than usual, only he was. Of course Kaeya was normal; it wasn’t as if he could trigger Kaeya’s rut. He didn’t want to, either, because Kaeya became miserable when he was in rut. He was unwilling to fuck, unwilling to do anything but curl up on his side and groan and weep. Diluc wasn’t entirely sure why that was, but he was almost certain that it was because of a Khaenri’an practice. Apparently, a dominant alpha’s scent would be used to suppress a young alpha’s first rut, and that would make them docile in all of their future ruts.\r\n\r\nStill, Kaeya wasn’t an ordinary alpha. Ordinary alphas usually rolled over and presented their throats when Diluc was in rut. Diluc knew that it was more about Kaeya’s mental powers than physical, but it must have been hard on him to have his rut suppressed like that, if it was the truth.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” Kaeya said, running a hand through Diluc’s sweat-dampened hair. “Pay attention.”\r\n\r\nDiluc met his eyes, but while he had wanted to glare, he saw a little smile on Kaeya’s lips. He closed his eyes again, but when Kaeya pulled out of his mouth, Diluc realized he had stopped coming.\r\n\r\nBoth of them were still hard, though. And, even though his knot was deflating, all it took was Kaeya’s hand around the base of his cock for it to swell again, pushing against his palm eagerly. Kaeya laughed. “It’s like you have a refresh button when you’re in rut.” He looked down at Diluc’s still-spread legs and asked, “Do you want me to…?”\r\n\r\nHis thoughts were totally incoherent. “I… want you.”\r\n\r\n“Inside of you?” he prompted.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t matter,” he said, shaking his head. “Just you.”\r\n\r\n“You’re so charming when you blush. It makes me want to do unspeakable things to you,” Kaeya said, kissing his cheek. He slid inside with almost no resistance. Diluc’s hole was lubricated by semen and his body relaxed by the overwhelming pheromones around them and inside of his body. The pheromones were in his scent gland and in his stomach after he had swallowed them during that kiss. Last time, the most prominent sound had been slapping skin, but now it was squelching, and Diluc felt embarrassed amidst his mindless lust.\r\n\r\nHe whispered, “I want to bite you again.”\r\n\r\nKaeya leaned over and let him bite his neck, groaning. “It hurts.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” he said, licking the wounds. He felt his pheromones leak out of Kaeya’s scent gland and felt his knot swell even more between them. “Sorry, Kae.”\r\n\r\nAs he moved, cradling Diluc’s head so that his fangs wouldn’t rip the wounds wider, Kaeya whispered in his ear. “I’m glad that this worked. I was afraid that it would hurt too much.”\r\n\r\nDiluc withdrew from his neck, kissing his lips briefly before saying, “How could I be in pain when I’m with you?” Kaeya seemed surprised, but it was true that Diluc hardly ever made love to him like that. With a sigh, Diluc pinched his cheek. “Don’t look so shocked, you prick. Kiss me already.”\r\n\r\nKaeya kissed him deeply. He opened his mouth, retracting his fangs when Kaeya retracted his. They gasped into one another’s mouths and their bodies strained toward each other, closer and closer.\r\nKaeya spoke breathlessly, and Diluc could feel that they were both close. “All I can smell is cinnamon and smoke and cloves.” Diluc smiled against his lips. “I’m craving mulled wine.”\r\n\r\n“Is that what I smell like?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” he said, “like fire in midwinter. And me?”\r\n\r\nIt was hard to reply while shivers of pleasure seized his body, but he said, “Like the early morning in late autumn, when there’s a bit of frost—” His breath hitched, but Kaeya let him finish, slowing his pace somewhat. “And the crystal flies are still out in the vineyard.”\r\n\r\nThey said nothing more, chasing release together until they climaxed. Kaeya pulled out after a moment of gasping, falling onto his side. As another extended ejaculation shuddered through Diluc’s body, Kaeya wrapped an arm around him and rolled onto his side. Pressing his front against Diluc’s back, Kaeya nuzzled against the side of his neck. “I want to wake up beside you on those mornings.”\r\n\r\n“Then move in again,” he said. The constant, unchanging contact with Kaeya’s body was soothing in the throes of his rut. “Or climb in through the window every now and then.”\r\n\r\nHe felt Kaeya grinning against the side of his neck. “Can I also call you my mate?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe.” Kaeya squeezed him tighter. “But, if you buy rings, isn’t ‘husband’ better?”\r\n\r\nKaeya whispered, “I love you so much.”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I know,” he said, as he intertwined their fingers. Atop the sheets, despite the haze in his mind, he could clearly picture the wedding bands. The rings would shine on their hands until their callouses were softened by old age. Lifting Kaeya’s hand, Diluc kissed his knuckles.\r\n\r\nKaeya said nothing, but Diluc felt the smile against his skin, and it was worth more than words.', 'kaeluc.jpg', '2021-04-26 11:11:55.949427', '2021-04-26 11:21:05.093154', '0', '0', 'melting_mid_season1', '1', '3', 'Melting Mid-season');
INSERT INTO `sueed_article` VALUES ('9', 'Frost in Midsummer', 'Kaeya goes into rut unexpectedly, and yet again, he has an idea. This time, though, he hasn\'t had much time to think through his plan. Thankfully, he can leave the matter in Diluc\'s hands.\r\nContinuation of \"Fire in Midwinter.\"', 'The sun was already setting over the statue of winged Barbatos, shrouding the flowing cloak he wore with crimson and golden light. For a moment, Kaeya allowed himself a smile, before he stood from his desk and stretched his arms over his head, hearing a couple stiff spots in his spine popping. On his desk, the pile of his completed work was as high as Diluc’s Pile ‘em Up record in one of the Ludi Harpastum festivals from when they’d been kids.\r\n\r\nSatisfied, he tucked in his chair, drew the curtains, and left his office. On his way out, he stopped by the library to say goodbye to Lisa, and then by Jean’s office to tell her to take a break, and then by solitary confinement to slip Klee a candy bar. Amber was out, probably. Hopefully, he’d get the chance to talk to her about some new intel on Treasure Hoarder activity in Old Monstadt tomorrow. If she stuck around for long enough after coming back at dawn to eat breakfast with Noelle, that was.\r\n\r\n“Oh, think of the devil,” he said under his breath, as he stepped out of the headquarters to find Noelle chatting with Huffman. As soon as the door closed, the two of them saluted him.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” Huffman said. “Going out for rounds?”\r\n\r\nHe waved it off as he started to walk toward the street. “Going home. I finished three weeks’ worth of work today.” Huffman nodded, but Kaeya paused when it looked like Noelle wanted to say something to him. “What’s up? Got something on your mind?”\r\n\r\nLooking a bit flustered, but quickly composing herself— because she was trying to impress him with her calibre as a knight-in-training, he knew— she told him, “Amber’s back in town. I ran into her at the Good Hunter and she asked me to let you know that Lord Ragnvindr returned from the summit in Fontaine with your intelligence network.”\r\n\r\nGrinning, Kaeya said, “Well, then, I’d better get home. What’s his mood like?”\r\n\r\nNoelle blinked, then admitted, “She didn’t say.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t she tell me herself?” he asked, feeling quite giddy. He restrained himself from tossing his coin or starting to skip down the street. It had been too long already, several months.\r\n\r\n“I…” Noelle hesitated, but in the end she said, “I’m not sure, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Alright,” he said, waving as he started to walk away. “Have a nice night.”\r\n\r\n“You too, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir!” Noelle said, before she realized her blunder and flushed with embarrassment. Kaeya smothered his laughter with his hand. It was only a few minutes before he passed by the patio of the Good Hunter. When he saw Amber eating with her friends from the Adventurer’s Guild, he decided to stop by and tell her to meet him in his office or at least leave a report before she left tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as he opened his mouth, invisible hammers struck his knees and took the strength out of his legs. A subtle sweetness threaded in the air, but it was enough to make his head spin. Barely in time, he caught himself on the back of her chair. His fangs lengthened, and he put a hand over his mouth. Startled, she looked up and started to smile, before her expression darkened and she covered her face with her hands. “Kaeya, you weren’t supposed to stop by. Go home!”\r\n\r\nShe was an omega; he had known that since they’d met. Everyone knew that. But Noelle was a beta, so of course she wouldn’t have smelled the fact that Amber was only a day or two away from going into heat. Of course. Just my luck. He should have expected it, ever since he had seen her forgotten box of suppressant medicine in the alchemy workshop two weeks ago, before she had ridden out.\r\n\r\nHis brain was melting. His rut was in a week, but he hadn’t had sex in months and now an omega in pre-heat was sitting right in front of him with her cloying scent drawing his alpha out.\r\n\r\nBennett and Fischl were looking confused, but soon enough Fischl smelled his pheromones and made a look of disgust, the same one any alpha would make. Looking frantic and with a nervous laugh, Bennett asked, “Uhh, what’s going on? Captain Alberich? You alright?”\r\n\r\nAmber was standing up carefully and reaching for her satchel, but Kaeya spoke first. He felt a mixture of nausea and unadulterated carnal desire heat his blood. “You forgot your suppressants. Amber, get away from me right now.” Dropping her satchel, Amber nodded and turned around, walking in the direction of the headquarters. As soon as she was at the edge of the empty patio, she started to run.\r\nChase her, his alpha said. But the part of it that had been killed in his childhood said, Sit down.\r\n\r\nSo, he sat down on the cobblestones and wrapped his arms around his gut, which was starting to ache with stabbing sensations. His fangs secreted pheromones continuously into his mouth, but to him it just tasted like saliva. Through blurry vision, he could see Sara telling citizens to stay away from the restaurant, and he could see Fischl trying not to vomit.\r\n\r\nWith the last bit of energy he had, he looked up at her and Bennett, saying, “Get Diluc.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t have time to hear their answers. Darkness overwhelmed his field of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memory of his first rut always came back to him whenever it happened. When he had been younger, a healer had talked to him about how most alphas recovered from it without experiencing any trauma. She had reasoned that he maintained it as a traumatic experience because he had not accepted that alpha as his prime alpha. How had he been meant to know what he was supposed to do? All he had known back then was that it had hurt and he was alone and his father was in the other room watching to make sure he was alright. But even though it hurt, nobody had decided he was not alright.\r\nAnd then his father had abandoned him with some patriotic bullshit. Maybe the reason his father hadn’t stopped it was because he didn’t actually care about Kaeya at all.\r\n\r\nThe experience had been full of haze and violent lust and agony.\r\n\r\nFirst, he had suddenly succumbed to his rut in the middle of an arithmetic class, and he remembered his best friend, an omega girl, crying. Later, he learned that he had thrown her away from him with such force that she had scraped her elbows on the floor.\r\n\r\nSecond, he remembered being manhandled into his father’s carriage, then held down by bodyguards and his own tutor. His father covered his nose with a handkerchief, like the stench was unbearable.\r\nThird, he was left in a dark room with two chairs. He was put in one chair and tied to it with padded shackles and a blindfold. He remembered hearing someone enter, then sit down across from him in the darkness. A voice as deep as a rumbling mountain had spoken to him gently. “Kaeya Alberich, can you hear me?” He had nodded, even as sweat poured down his back and he felt so hot that he was close to fainting. “Good. You know what is about to happen. It will hurt. But it is for the best. For Khaenri’ah.”\r\n“For Khaenri’ah,” he had repeated breathlessly, before the alpha’s scent had flooded the room.\r\n\r\nHe had blacked out, then he had lost his mind. He remembered screaming and swearing and writhing against his binds, pheromones leaking out of his young fangs painfully. He remembered having an uncomfortable erection go down as abruptly as if he had been kicked with the heel of a boot. He remembered the incredible feeling of loneliness, because while he could smell the alpha in front of him, he could see nothing. He wasn’t spoken to, and he was too incoherent to ask for anything.\r\n\r\nHe only sobbed and begged until he lost consciousness again.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to, he felt dizzy and weak, and his fangs had retracted on their own. A few minutes after that, the alpha had apologized to him and ruffled his hair as if there were no hard feelings. His father had come to get him. He had sat staring into space with a dead feeling in his chest for a week before going back to school feeling as if someone had cut a part of him to pieces.\r\n\r\nHe had apologized to his friend and she had beamed at him and hugged him, saying she was glad that he was alright. Back then, he had thought that he was glad she could be his friend because of what they had done to him, but what he hadn’t known was that the effects would wear off in time.\r\n\r\nThe effects, but not the memory.\r\n\r\nKaeya blinked awake to see Diluc’s face blur into focus. Feeling relieved, he closed his eyes again and focused on the feeling of Diluc mopping his brow. His voice was like the gentle crackling of a campfire. “Two kids from the Guild carried you here. How are you feeling?”\r\n\r\nFischl didn’t lose it? Tough girl. Keeping his eyes closed, Kaeya said, “I’m fine.”\r\n\r\nDiluc left the cool cloth on his forehead. There was the sound of shuffling before Kaeya felt a handkerchief on his cheek. Mercilessly, Diluc told him, “You were crying.”\r\n\r\n“How embarrassing.” He tried for a smile, but he could sense that Diluc was having none of it. \r\nTentatively, he opened his eyes and looked at Diluc properly, seeing that he was breathing through his mouth instead of his nose. He had put thick bandages around his neck, over his scent glands. He was still fully-clothed, with his gloves too. Every place on his body that released his scent was covered.\r\n\r\nDiluc followed his gaze and said, “You should try to sleep through it. I didn’t want you to wake up because of my scent.” Kaeya chuckled, as his stomach ached and almost killed the painful erection that strained against his trousers. He knew that Diluc was making a point of not looking in that direction. “I was thinking of calling Lisa to stay with you… Jean told me she used to stay and read terribly dry alchemy books to you sometimes.”\r\n\r\nFeeling desperate for some reason, Kaeya grasped his wrist. “No.” He said the word so quickly that it felt like a gasp, and Diluc looked at him with surprise. Kaeya held his gaze. “No, please stay.”\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Diluc said, “I can hardly breathe, Kaeya. Let’s not make this harder on us both.”\r\n\r\nHe held firm. “Let’s have sex.”\r\n\r\n“Are you crazy?” Diluc twisted out of his grip easily, laughing and shaking his head. He wet and wrung out the cloth again. “The only emotions you associate with your ruts are negative ones, and I don’t want to be a part of that. I’m an alpha, Kaeya. I’m not going to be able to erase your memories.”\r\n\r\nIt was when Diluc started to stand up that he struggled upright and reached for him, only just missing his coattails. The rut made him too slow. He wet his lips and stared after Diluc until he was opening the door, but fear overwhelmed him. He heard his voice break. “Luc, please.”\r\n\r\nDiluc stopped, made a sound of frustration, then banged his head against the door once. After a moment in which his shoulders tremored, he cursed, locked the door, and pulled off his coat. Why did it always look so sexy whenever Diluc got rid of his clothes? Maybe because he was always wearing too many layers. After his coat, he unfastened his tie, shrugged out of his vest, then yanked off his gloves.\r\n\r\nStill standing by the door, he undid the buckles of his sword belts and pulled off the dagger sheath around his thigh. Kaeya watched him unbutton his shirt, revealing pale skin and toned muscles one shadow at a time. Only wearing his trousers, socks having been left behind, he crossed the room again. He sat cross-legged at the foot of the bed with his biceps pressed against his sides to keep his scent from permeating from his underarms. Diluc wet his lips.\r\n\r\nKaeya pushed the blanket off and took off his shirt, then started to reach out. Suddenly, Diluc put up a hand. He froze, waiting. Diluc raked a hand through his hair, loosening it from its tie. Then, after a long silence, he spoke. “I know that Khaenri\'ahn alphas will bare their throat to another alpha when they rut. Can you actually push me down once I take off these bandages?”\r\n\r\nThe reassuring smile he had plastered on his face faltered. Probably not. Definitely not. No. Why are you so perceptive? Trying not to let his nerves creep in to his voice, he said, “Of course I can. Haven’t I made love to you hundreds of times? Or should I not put ‘intercourse’ that romantically?”\r\n\r\nDiluc sighed. “Only a handful of times, you cocky bastard.” Then, meeting his gaze sharply, he added, “And don’t lie to me. You might be able to trick everyone else, but I’m not that thick.”\r\n\r\nHe wanted to make a witty retort, but the truth was that he was scared out of his wits. He didn’t want to be alone with his memories now. Earlier in the year, hadn’t they managed to get through Diluc’s rut together? Wasn’t that engagement ring waiting in his nightstand patiently? Why couldn’t he just put the matter in Diluc’s hands and hope for the best? So what if I break down into tears? He’s my brother-in-arms, my best friend, my lover, my everything. He’s seen me cry over a scraped knee before. What’s more pathetic than that? Nothing. Diluc’s gaze was both searing and warm. It’ll be okay.\r\n\r\nKaeya said, “Just… kiss me first. Hmm?”\r\n\r\nHe seemed concerned. “Look, if you can’t get it up once you take a whiff, there’s only one way to have sex, Kaeya.” Shut up shut up shut up. “And I don’t want to do that to you if you don’t want it.”\r\n\r\nA tangle of emotion exploded in his chest. “Well, I want you to, so shut up and get on with it.”\r\n\r\nBefore Diluc could snap at him in return, Kaeya grabbed his face and sealed his lips, forcing his mouth open with a harsh bite on his lower lip. Diluc’s fingers dug into his biceps with bruising force, and Kaeya nearly cut his tongue on his fangs. Already out. It’s my scent, isn’t it? He’s so calm, though. Kaeya almost laughed at himself. Well, it’s Diluc. Of course he’s calm.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, kissing Diluc was straightforward— Diluc kissed him with dominating passion, and he surrendered to it with an inevitable smile on his lips and laughter in his heart. But now, Diluc let him take control over it. The feeling was unsettling, as if he was trying to be gentle. Kaeya didn’t like it at all. If his alpha hadn’t been beaten half to death when he had been a kid, maybe he would have liked it more. He tried to pull Diluc closer, even though it was impossible. He tried to relax his lips, but Diluc’s only response was a sweet tug on his lower lip and a caress on his cheek with rough callouses.\r\n\r\nCome on, just stop being sweet to me, he thought desperately. Just—\r\n\r\nKaeya pulled away when he realized that he didn’t know what he wanted. Diluc didn’t ask, he only sat and waited, as if he had anticipated this confusion. He looked between Diluc’s knowing eyes and his own violently shaking hands. His breaths were getting harsher and harsher, and Diluc was still suppressing his own scent enough that Kaeya couldn’t even smell it.\r\n\r\nWhat do I want? he asked himself, trying to be rational. I don’t want to fuck. I just want him to hold me. But I want to get this out of my system. I want to wipe these stupid memories out of my head. I want his scent to replace the one from that day.\r\n\r\nTaking his shoulders, Kaeya said, “Diluc.”\r\n\r\nHe raised an eyebrow. “Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Fuck me.”\r\n\r\nDiluc stared at him blankly. Then, after a moment, he burst out with laughter. “Who are you?” he asked, with a flush high on his cheeks from his amusement. “Where’s Kaeya Alberich? Give him back to me. As arrogant and suave as he is, I like him quite a lot.”\r\n\r\n“Diluc, be serious,” he pleaded, tightening his grip slightly. “I’m serious.”\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Diluc pushed his hands away. “You don’t mean it, trust me. It hurts like a bitch, it takes preparation. It’s not going to work out the first time around unless you’re willing to grit your teeth.”\r\n“I am,” he said, searching Diluc’s eyes for a shred of sympathy instead of that cold logic that he always loved, except now. “I want you to bite me. Suppress my pheromones.”\r\n\r\nDiluc was silent for a moment, turning his gaze away. As Kaeya reached out again, he turned back suddenly and spoke with urgency. “Non-mutual pheromone suppression is psychological torture, Kaeya. It’s not sex, it’s pain. I’m not going to do that to you, not even if you get on your knees and beg me.”\r\n\r\n“That’s why I said, fuck me instead.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the same—”\r\n\r\nHe put his hand over Diluc’s mouth. “It’s not. Just do what I did last time. I bite you, you bite me. Pheromone confusion ensues. It’ll be alright. I trust you.”\r\n\r\nDiluc wrestled his hand away, his eyes full of anger. “Yeah, it’ll be fine, until I bite you and you have a heart attack! Look, I know that you get off on putting yourself in danger, but I’m not going to play games with your health or your life, Kaeya! Maybe I can bite you when you’re not in rut, but when you are? Who the fuck knows what’ll go wrong? I have a pheromone disorder and you have trauma. Don’t be stupid.”\r\n\r\n“So you’ll leave me here to suffer alone? Is that your idea of caring about me?”\r\n\r\nThe look in Diluc’s eyes was positively threatening. “Don’t say that kind of bullshit to me.”\r\n\r\n“If you hate it when I say that kind of bullshit, then listen to me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that just because I roll over for you in bed I’ll always do it?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you’re being a hero, Diluc?”\r\n\r\nA flash of rage in his crimson eyes. “Not another word, or I will lock you in here.” Since Kaeya made an exaggerated, sarcastic gesture showing that he was zipping his lips, Diluc glared at him. Then, after a moment, he turned his gaze down at the sheets between then. He seemed to be thinking about the matter deeply, until he asked, “How will we know if things are working smoothly?”\r\n\r\nKaeya considered it, too, before he reasoned, “Well, if I bite you first, then you bite me… every now and then, you can release more pheromones. If I bare my throat, nothing’s changed. If I release pheromones, or my fangs lengthen, it’s different. Probably.”\r\n\r\n“Probably?”\r\n\r\n“My fangs retracted by themselves, back then. And I couldn’t release pheromones.”\r\n\r\nDiluc seemed to hesitate, but he emboldened himself. “Are you really sure about this?”\r\n\r\nWith a grin that he hoped was reassuring, Kaeya poked his nose. “Be gentle with me.”\r\n\r\nHis gaze flicked between Kaeya’s eyes and his lips. There was still a substantial hesitation in the space between them. Diluc reached out and cupped his cheeks with both hands before leaning in, pressing their brows together. Softly, he said, “You don’t need to ask.”\r\n\r\n“How romantic,” Kaeya chuckled, trying to tilt his head back for a kiss. “What a fine gentleman stoic Master Diluc can be… But are you sure you’ll pass up an opportunity to put me in my place?”\r\n\r\nWith an exasperated but affectionate huff of laughter, Diluc said, “Don’t tempt me.”\r\n\r\nIt was a little strange when Diluc lowered him to the sheets and started to unbuckle his belt while looking in the direction of the nightstand. A few moments later, they were both naked, a bottle of oil was on the bed, and Diluc reached for the bandages around his neck. He paused, though, asking, “There’s no chance in Celestia that your alpha is going to try to kill me?”\r\n\r\nKaeya looked between the bandages and Diluc’s retracted canines. “Wouldn’t say ‘no’ chance.”\r\n\r\nHe looked around the room. “I’ll get my tie.”\r\n\r\n“Or you could hold me down yourself,” he suggested, with a smirk, putting his wrists together above his head. “That would be quite ungentlemanly of you, though.”\r\n\r\nDiluc rolled his eyes. “Oh, shut up. You can just say that you want me to.”\r\n\r\n“That wouldn’t be any fun.”\r\n\r\nAs he interlocked the fingers of his right hand around Kaeya’s wrists, Diluc casually said, “I know you think you’re tough, but sex pheromones aren’t the only ones you’re releasing right now.” Kaeya could feel his smile falter in response. “If you get scared, just tell—”\r\n\r\nKaeya interrupted him as loudly as he could. “Nope. I’m the toughest man in all of Teyvat.”\r\n\r\nDiluc bowed his head, and Kaeya craned his neck to see his expression, but he was laughing. The sight wrenched a sigh of relief from his lungs. He said, “Captain Alberich, I have the utmost confidence going forth that you will demonstrate your calibre as the toughest toddler in Teyvat.”\r\n\r\nLetting his head fall back to the pillow, Kaeya sighed. “What high esteem you hold me in.”\r\n\r\n“The highest,” Diluc said, before he pulled off the bandages and kissed him deeply. As soon as the smell of his pheromones swelled in the air, Kaeya’s mind emptied. His heart clenched painfully and the arousal brought on by his rut vanished entirely. To keep Diluc from hesitating now, he put all of his energy into the kiss and squeezed his eyes shut. His throat was tight with tears of agony, and it was a white-hot feeling that moved away from his scent glands through his whole body.\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t breathe, but he didn’t have the courage to let Diluc pull away and notice that he was trying not to scream. Diluc had retracted his fangs, but occasionally they returned for the span of a breath and dripped pheromones into his mouth, scalding his tongue and the roof of his mouth like boiling water.\r\n\r\nClove and smoke and cinnamon— the smells suffocated him and make his skin feel like it was between turning to ashes and breaking out into cold sweat. It was as torturous as it had been back then, but he wanted it to be different. Why isn’t it different? Why does it matter if he’s an alpha?\r\n\r\nAgainst his mouth, Diluc said, “Bite me.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated when he opened his eyes at the sight of Diluc’s ruddy curls trapped under his fingers against the elegant curve of his neck. Aside from a smattering of freckles, nothing marred the fair skin there, all of the marks from their last session of lovemaking many months ago long vanished. Abruptly, he felt a violent desire to cover Diluc in evidence of him. Even though his fangs had retracted before, all it took was Diluc kissing his scent gland chastely for them to lengthen completely.\r\n\r\nWith a growl he couldn’t stop, he sank his teeth in. Diluc made a quiet noise of pain against his neck, his exhale hot and moist. His vision was throbbing with black and red spots. For the first time in his life, he had the sensation that his pheromone glands were turning dry. “Kaeya,” Diluc said. His voice was tight and breathy at the same time. “Stop. It’s too much.”\r\n\r\nHe tried to pull away.\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t.\r\n\r\nDiluc seemed to realize it in the moment before he passed out, because he lurched back, baring his teeth and pressing a hand down on Kaeya’s chest firmly. Through thick haze, he could see blood on Diluc’s beautiful skin, but he could also see the scratch marks his fingernails were leaving on his forearm. Gasping, he tried to calm down. What am I doing? he wondered, feeling somewhat detached from his body. Diluc was swaying, and his scent was strange, almost sleepy.\r\n\r\nWhat did I do to him? Returning to himself somewhat, since Diluc hadn’t moved an inch in too long, he felt his fangs with his tongue. He found that not even a drop of liquid pheromone was clinging to the bone. Oh, shit. Shit. He’s not an omega. He’s going to pass out. “Luc.”\r\n\r\nDiluc’s voice sounded faraway, or underwater. “I’m… fine. Can’t see much, though.”\r\n\r\nKaeya rubbed his eyes with the back of his wrist. “Me neither. Did I hurt you?”\r\n\r\n“I’m fine,” he repeated, even though Kaeya could tell that Diluc was about as ‘fine’ as he was himself, which was… not very fine. With a deeper inhale, he spoke again. “I can probably make my way around you blindfolded, though. A little blurriness won’t stop me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Master Diluc, fire of my loins, what poetry that is to my ears—”\r\n\r\nDiluc put a hand over his mouth, laughing tiredly. “Shut up, shut up. If I laugh I’ll never be able to get it up again.” Kaeya licked the palm of his hand and he laughed some more. “Hey, behave.”\r\n\r\nWithout allowing him the time to make a witty retort, Diluc flipped him over. He was very unused to being manhandled, especially in bed. But when he thought about it, that was the sort of no-nonsense style of lovemaking he expected from Diluc.\r\n\r\nYet again, before he could flirt to distract himself from his painful erection and painful fangs and painful everything, Diluc moved first. Kaeya felt the warmth of his chest against his back, the tickle of his hair caught between them, and the rough edge of his cracked lower lip. On his nape.\r\n\r\nDiluc kissed his skin too many times, each soft touch sending a new butterfly kicking the walls of his stomach with the force of a geovishap hatchling’s tail barb. Then, the feeling of his tongue, and his fangs, and pheromones hissing against his scent gland.\r\n\r\nKaeya’s view of the bedframe turned whiter than a snowstorm as Diluc bit him. He came to when he heard the choked sound that left his throat, as his body started to struggle regardless of his slow thoughts. They both knew that Kaeya would never be able to throw him off. In skill, they were equal, but in strength, there was no rivaling Diluc now that he had been pinned down. Swinging a claymore and swinging a sword were different things.\r\n\r\nAs he drew away, Diluc asked, “Does it hurt?”\r\n\r\nHis head was throbbing. The mixture of their scents in his nose wasn’t a very calming one, not with that rutting-alpha-musk mixed in. “What sort of… stupid non-question… is that?”\r\n\r\nDiluc ignored his retort and kept on holding him down with the weight of his hips, his hand still locked around Kaeya’s wrists. After a moment of useless struggling on the part of Kaeya’s alpha, Diluc reached for the bottle of oil and seemed to be wetting his left hand after pulling out the cork with his teeth. Kaeya couldn’t move enough to look over his shoulder, but Diluc wasn’t touching him.\r\n\r\nAfter few seconds, Diluc told him, “Put your knees together.”\r\n\r\nHe had enough of his thoughts intact to say, “It’s ‘spread your legs,’ Luc.”\r\n\r\nThe sigh he loosed was full of exasperation. “Just listen to me.”\r\n\r\nKaeya listened to him, even though he was having a small crisis. One third of him was being rational about the fact that Diluc was about to fuck him. The second third was panicking because he was very sure that Diluc had slept with many women and that listening to him bitching about how much it hurt was not going to leave a lovely impression. The last third was his alpha, who was very uncomfortable and probably the third of him that was making his hands shake uncontrollably while cold sweat dripped down his spine. Holy shit. This is not on my bucket list. Please tell me he was exaggerating when he said it ‘hurts like a bitch.’ His thoughts were cut off by Diluc’s voice, full of amusement.\r\n\r\n“Feeling a little frightened, Captain?”\r\n\r\n“You could stand to call me something sweeter in bed.”\r\n\r\n“Not when I’m making fun of you,” he said, and his hips moved.\r\n\r\nKaeya experienced a moment of shock, but no pain followed, because Diluc seemed not to have intended to put it in in the first place. Somehow, he was disappointed, but intense relief quickly overwhelmed the feeling. Then pleasure overwhelmed all of the other feelings, and he closed his eyes as Diluc thrust between his thighs. With every movement, delicious friction sent a small wave of pleasure up his spine, and he could hear Diluc’s harsh breaths in his ear.\r\n\r\n“I must admit,” he said between gasps, “this is a creative solution.”\r\n\r\n“You’re so talkative when you’re not on top.”\r\n\r\n“Without you moaning underneath me, there’s not enough noise.” The truth was that Diluc was quiet during sex no matter what, and Kaeya was often beyond words when between Diluc’s legs.\r\n\r\n“Fuck you,” Diluc snapped.\r\n\r\n“You’re the one who passed up the chance, love.” He shuddered as he felt Diluc’s knot swelling slightly. How? Without any omega, outside of rut… how is it…? Can feelings actually make a difference with this? Diluc’s fingers were pressing into his hips with enough firmness to leave his muscles tender, but the urgency of his thrusts did not distract Kaeya from this newfound knowledge.\r\n\r\nI wonder… last time I inhaled some of that pheromone perfume too, but could I actually knot like this? Diluc seemed to hear his thoughts. His voice low and roughened by arousal, he asked, “Is it possible to knot without an omega?” The way he angled his hips as he said it made Kaeya sink his teeth into his lip to avoid the moan that struggled up his throat. Shit, I’m going to come. He asked again when Kaeya didn’t answer. “Hey, is it possible? Last time we needed that perfume. I’m kind of—” A pause as he caught his breath. “I’m kind of freaking out. This isn’t normal, is it?”\r\n\r\n“How would I know?” he asked, as blood rushed between his dick and his head. It was so incredibly hot that he felt he was going to combust or melt into a puddle. “I haven’t had intercrural sex with an alpha during my rut before. Don’t think you have, either.”\r\n\r\n“I’d kill you if you had,” Diluc said, somewhere between amused and possessive.\r\n\r\nOh, fuck, that is a sexy tone of voice. Such was Kaeya’s last thought before his ejaculation snatched the air out of his lungs, flattened him against the mattress, and gave his fangs the feeling that they’d been plucked out. Above him, Diluc had let go of his wrists. He was kneeling and stroking himself. Kaeya had enough strength and lust left in him that he rolled onto his side to watch.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were half-lidded, long lashes fluttering. With a lovely flush high on his cheeks and his lower lip captured lopsidedly between his teeth, he made an artfully obscene sight. It brought logic back to Kaeya’s mind more than he had expected it would. He propped his cheek on his hand and ogled openly. Diluc’s crimson hair, looking like silk in the dimness, made his ivory skin seem impossibly soft.\r\n\r\nAs he watched Diluc stroke himself, one hand around his knot and the other around his shaft, Kaeya wet his lips and tried to say something to make him react snappishly. He was cute when he snapped. But Diluc met his eyes as soon as his gaze drifted upward. His mouth was abruptly dry, and there was so much lust and heat in Diluc’s gaze that Kaeya could feel himself hardening again, even though he no longer had the feeling that he was in rut.\r\n\r\nThat… was strange, actually. He could even smell his own pheromones in the room. What about what they had done had solved his problem? Was it… was it simply because he and Diluc had been together during this rut? Could it be that simple? His ruts weren’t as violent as Diluc’s, since he didn’t have a pheromone disorder, but it wasn’t usually that easy to clear his head.\r\n\r\nHe was cut off when Diluc spoke breathlessly. “Kaeya.” His attention fully summoned back to the delectable sight in front of him, he raised an eyebrow. After a moment, Diluc bent over and kissed him. His eyes widened at first, but he smiled as he returned the gesture. As soon as their kiss deepened, Diluc’s body flinched against his, and then he shuddered.\r\n\r\nHe caught himself clumsily on one elbow, but Kaeya pulled him down and took his weight as he came, the knot prolonging it. They kissed lazily throughout, fingers untangling snaggles in each other’s hair and legs shifting the blankets until they slipped off the bed. When it was over, Diluc drew away from their kiss and whispered, “I love you.”\r\n\r\nThat must be the second time you’ve said that aloud. His heart began to thunder as Diluc offered up a small, sweet smile. Kaeya stared at him in dumb shock, simultaneously wanting to kiss him, snuggle with him, have sex again, and put the ring in the nightstand on his finger. So, he made a plan to do all of those things, in a different sequence. He started with a kiss, and between kisses Diluc told him, “You started releasing pheromones when I knotted. Do you feel better?”\r\n\r\n“Infinitely,” he said, “but now I actually feel like having sex. Properly.” With the final word, he squeezed Diluc’s buttocks, and Diluc only kissed him again in response. As he fumbled for the bottle of oil and Diluc kept his hand away from it, he laughed. “What, do you want to have your way with me?”\r\nDiluc seemed to deliberate over this seriously. Then he shrugged. “Eventually.”\r\n\r\n“Eventually?” he asked, as he poured the oil on his hand and reached behind Diluc again.\r\n“When you least expect it,” he said, his voice a sultry whisper in Kaeya’s left ear. “Just as you think you’re being clever, making some joke about having me on my back, I’ll pin you down.” As Kaeya slipped in a finger, Diluc bit his earlobe. “Then I’ll ravage you until your voice is hoarse.”\r\n\r\nNot entirely in jest, Kaeya said, “I look forward to it.”\r\n\r\nThe laughter Diluc let out in response tickled the side of his neck. He shifted his weight on the bed to get into a better position, despite Diluc’s arms holding him too close to get a good look at what he was doing. He kissed a line from Diluc’s collarbones toward his scent gland. As soon as he inhaled the scent, his brain short-circuited. Cloves, cinnamon, smoke— Diluc’s scent. Mixed with it, an alpha’s smell, but the alpha’s musk was his. Diluc’s oppressive musk was somewhere in the background, barely there.\r\nWas he capable of pheromone suppression again? Had time really fixed him? Or was Diluc letting him do it in hopes to fix it? He had no idea, but while his conscious mind asked these questions, his alpha clawed at the walls of his mind and squeezed beneath the crack under the door. As he felt himself begin to heat up in a way that he had a foggy memory of from childhood, a heat that coiled under his skin like molten iron, he laughed breathlessly. Diluc opened his eyes, ceasing to focus on the feeling of Kaeya’s fingers.\r\n\r\nHe asked, “Is something wrong?”\r\n\r\nKaeya met his eyes. His vision shifted between blurry and clear and too clear. The pheromones were coming back into his fangs with a pulling sensation. “I… don’t think my rut is done.”\r\n\r\nDiluc blinked. “You’re feeling better?”\r\n\r\n“It’s—” A wave of pleasure swept over his body, even though Diluc hadn’t done anything to him, and he shuddered, bowing his head. “It’s not pleasant. I feel a little sick.”\r\n\r\n“That means you’re alright,” he said. “It never feels good in full force.”\r\n\r\nHis sight sharpened again. The lines of Diluc’s body duplicated for a moment, before his vision adjusted and everything was very clear. He could see Diluc’s pulse at his throat, throbbing gently under his pale skin. He could see his pheromones moving through Diluc’s scent gland. He could see the absence of Diluc’s knot, the flush of his body and the soft invitation of his thighs. His brain wasn’t working properly.\r\n\r\nInvitation. Invitation? Diluc’s thighs are so muscular that when he tenses they feel like stone.\r\n\r\nStill, the fingers of his left hand pressed into soft flesh. When Diluc winced, Kaeya knew that it only felt soft because his grip was too strong. He removed his hand. “I shouldn’t do this, I think.”\r\n\r\n“It’s okay,” Diluc said, reaching up to unfasten his eyepatch, smoothing the rough pad of his thumb under the glass eye. His eyes were honest, direct. “I can probably stop you if I need to. There are advantages to my pheromone disorder, I suppose, even if they aren’t numerous.”\r\n\r\nKaeya worked at loosening him up for a few agonizing minutes, while he had the vulgar and desperate urge to start rutting against the sheets. His head was full of haze, and Diluc moved in and out of his field of view, occasionally looking like a beautiful marble statue in the sheets and occasionally parting his lips with a gasp, showing his sharp alpha fangs.\r\n\r\nBefore he even knew was he was doing, he withdrew his hand and bared his teeth, growling. Diluc’s eyes widened, but his pupils sharpened into slits. Alpha. Kill him. He struggled in vain against his alpha as his fangs dripped with bitter, vile pheromones. No, no. No. Stop. He covered his mouth with his hand, but uncovered it moments later. They weren’t sex pheromones. They were deadly, he could recognize the taste of the poisonous anger and violence dripping onto his tongue. He was immune to it, but Diluc wasn’t.\r\n\r\n“Diluc—” He shut his eyes, trying to control himself, but his fangs lengthened even more, and the growl in his throat drowned out all of his thoughts. He needed to tell Diluc to run.\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t even see anymore. Everything was a blur of lurid colours, pheromones, pulsing with crimson at the edges. Pain shot through his temples as his alpha seized his mind. Having been chained down for too long, it tore off its shackles with bitter loathing and bloodlust.\r\n\r\nKaeya opened his mouth, and his pheromones dripped down, sizzling as they touched Diluc’s abdomen. He heard a hiss of pain, distantly. Everything focused on Diluc’s throat. Defensive. His chin was tucked down. He won’t submit? Kill him. Kill him. Get rid of your enemy, then find an omega.\r\nHe was leaning forward when Diluc suddenly moved. His chin moved upward, until the lines of his throat were stretched long, dangerously exposed. His eyes were closed, and his breathing was barely controlled, tremulous. His limbs relaxed as he put his hands to either side of his head, palms up. Unthreatening. Baring his throat. Kaeya’s alpha hesitated.\r\n\r\nThen, understanding the situation, he moved, too, bringing his fangs close, pheromones changing, sinking his teeth into Diluc’s scent gland. He pushed his hips forward, entering forcefully.\r\n\r\nDiluc made a choked sound of pain underneath him. Wrapping his arms around Kaeya, he dug his nails in. Kaeya couldn’t hear him, but he was saying something adamantly. His fangs itched horribly, but it was better with Diluc’s scent around them, just the scent of mulled wine and no musk.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, though, he felt something strike the small of his back, stopping his push inside. Then, the pheromones in his lungs changed, and he detected the sour odour of wine that was too young. His fangs started to burn, and he lurched away. Abruptly, he was on his back, and Diluc wrapped a hand around his throat. He pushed down. Kaeya pushed back, bucking his hips, but Diluc pulled off of him and pushed his knee into Kaeya’s thigh with painful force.\r\n\r\nWhen his vision started to blur again, and air left his lungs, Kaeya finally pushed past his alpha and spoke. Putting his hands over Diluc’s, he wheezed, “Diluc. Luc, please—”\r\n\r\nInstantly, Diluc let go of his neck. He sat above Kaeya, panting heavily, bleeding from his scent gland. His eyes were wide with fear and shock, and as their gazes met, he covered his face with his hands. Kaeya reached toward him, hoping to apologize, but Diluc was the one who said, “I’m sorry.” Kaeya paused, settling on the mattress again as he recovered his breath. “I’m so sorry,” Diluc whispered, sounding horrified. “I didn’t want to hurt you like they did.”\r\n\r\nReaching up, he pulled Diluc’s fingers away from his face. “Don’t apologize. I almost killed you.”\r\nDiluc met his gaze again. “I wouldn’t have let you. I was hoping you would calm down if I bared my throat. If you hadn’t calmed down, I would have pushed you down sooner.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t hurt me. I’m fine.” Pointing to his neck, which wasn’t even sore anymore, he said with what he hoped was a reassuring smile, “See? Not even a bruise. You’re so good at strangling your enemies that you don’t even leave a proper mark.”\r\n\r\n“Just crushed windpipes,” he protested, but amusement crept in faintly. They held one another’s gazes for a moment longer. Kaeya’s smile turned genuine as the concern faded from Diluc’s face, and with a sigh he lowered himself to lie atop Kaeya. He asked, “Are you feeling more sane?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, running a hand through Diluc’s hair. “I didn’t mean to lose it.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “I think it’s easier to lose control when you’re the one doing the fucking.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t really gotten around to it yet,” he said, cautiously reaching around to check if he had managed to hurt Diluc when pushing inside. With relief, he found that there was no sign of tearing.\r\n\r\nDiluc raised an eyebrow, but ignored Kaeya’s touch. “You’d better get on with it, then. I can hardly just cuddle with you when you’re this hard.” As if to emphasize his point, he reached between their abdomens and rubbed the heel of his hand against Kaeya’s member.\r\n\r\nPushing Diluc’s hair away from his bleeding scent gland, Kaeya licked the wound, feeling Diluc tense and relax again at every sweep of his tongue. When he drew away, he said, “Bite me, too.”\r\n\r\n“Again?”\r\n\r\n“Better to be confused than murderous.”\r\n\r\n“True,” Diluc said, and carefully slid his fangs into the same wound from before. Kaeya knew that there would only be one wound on his scent gland, but on Diluc’s there were several, overlapping and painful just to look at. Kaeya licked them again, silently apologizing.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, distantly, Diluc’s alpha musk kicked in. Since it started in his scent gland rather than in his nose, it jarred him a bit. Still, even though his alpha writhed against his binds somewhere deep within Kaeya’s mind, he ignored it and breathed in deeply. His body seemed to remember that the last time they had both had their teeth in each other’s necks was when Kaeya had knotted him.\r\n\r\nHis knot was swelling.\r\n\r\nDiluc felt it against his thigh and suddenly pulled away. “Kae—”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t have the time to finish. Kaeya knew that he wouldn’t be able to put it in again if it swelled too much. Without putting it in, he wouldn’t get any release from the terrible feeling of mixed nausea, arousal, and heat that was pooling low in his stomach. So, Kaeya flipped them over, spread Diluc’s legs, and sheathed himself inside. Diluc gasped, his fingers clutching Kaeya’s biceps with bruising force.\r\n\r\nHis knot took another thrust to push inside. Diluc instinctively tried to close his legs, but there was no hiss of pain— the knot wasn’t big enough to hurt yet. Hitting his fist against Kaeya’s chest, Diluc snapped, “That was too sudden, you—”\r\n\r\nKaeya shut him up with a kiss, swallowing the rare moan of pleasure that left Diluc’s lips. He started to thrust, and at first it was a struggle, with his knot getting slightly larger every time he pulled out. But, at some point, Diluc’s body moving along with his hips, he managed to set a rhythm. Diluc wrapped his arms around Kaeya’s neck and refused to break the kiss as their pheromones mixed again in his mouth, like last time. Pleasure crackled along his skin like electricity as they moved.\r\n\r\nAt some point, Diluc pulled away from the kiss and buried his face in the side of Kaeya’s neck. He panted, his hands tugging gently at Kaeya’s hair as he said, “It’s— too big. Stop moving—”\r\n\r\nYanking him back by his hair, Kaeya sealed his lips again, pushing inside with a powerful thrust of his hips. Diluc’s body jolted, and a noise of muffled surprise moved between their lips as he stretched to accommodate Kaeya’s knot. The tight heat that wrapped around his knot made his mind go empty.\r\n\r\nOh, fuck. Fuck. Did it feel like this last time?\r\n\r\nDiluc kissed him breathlessly, sloppily, his chest rising and falling erratically. Kaeya had to pull away after a moment longer, too short of breath to kiss properly. Dizzily, he reached between them and started to stroke Diluc. Maybe I’m doing it too quickly, he thought, as he watched Diluc’s cheeks flush even further, his mouth falling open in silent pleasure as his body flinched.\r\n\r\nWith every flinch, every time Kaeya pressed his thumb into the slit, Diluc tightened around him. The more abruptly he did it, the shakier his hand became, the more it felt like an omega orgasming around him. He shut his eyes and tried to focus on holding himself back. But when Diluc released with a muffled groan, he couldn’t stop the rush of heat that flowed over his body. The pleasure started at the place where they were connected and moved over every nerve in his body, finishing with a tingling feeling on his scalp and in his scent gland.\r\n\r\nGasping, he caught himself from collapsing on top of Diluc. His balls felt too tight, and the ejaculation seemed infinite. Holy shit. Holy Archons above. It was very different to last time. Last time, he hadn’t been in rut. Diluc looked exhausted underneath him, his eyes closed as his hands slipped away from Kaeya’s neck. He seemed to be catching his breath.\r\n\r\nHis spend painted his abdomen, but there was no sign of knotting. It was normal; typically an alpha outside of rut could only knot once every few days. Unsure of what he was doing, Kaeya touched him. Diluc’s eyes snapped open. He started to ask, “What are you—”\r\n\r\nWhen he started to stroke Diluc, he earned a shuddering gasp, and Diluc tightened around him. Another surge of pleasure pulsed through his body while he came, and he closed his eyes, revelling in it for a moment. He moved his hand again, and Diluc started to bite the back of his wrist. His thighs shook on top of Kaeya’s, and the sheets twisted underneath him as he writhed.\r\n\r\nFuck, it feels like he’s milking me. He gave an experimental squeeze, moving his hand from base to tip, and Diluc finally split the silence. “Stop it! It’s too sensitive—” He cut off as Kaeya moved his hand more quickly, and used his wrist to muffle the sounds again. Diluc was always quiet during sex.\r\n\r\nHe only gasped, breathed heavily, and groaned— but he only groaned when he was coming. Kaeya had a wild impulse to wrench out every sound he could from Diluc’s lips. He wanted to make a mess out of him and breed him until he couldn’t move.\r\n\r\nWhat’s that thinking? he wondered, with some amusement. He’s not an omega, and I don’t wish he was. I can’t do anything like that to him. Well, I can make a mess out of him, though…\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a spark of pleasure ignited across his skin. He looked down to see that Diluc had pinched his nipple between his thumb and forefinger. Entertained, Kaeya quickened the pace of his hand. “Are you taking advantage of knowing how sensitive an alpha is in rut? That’s a little fiendish of you.”\r\n\r\nDiluc grit his teeth and met his eyes. “Let go.”\r\n\r\n“I want you to come again, so… no,” Kaeya said. He started to feel some of his semen against his knot, so he shifted forward, pushing Diluc’s weight further up his back. He only realized the strange thing he had done when Diluc made a face. Surprised, Kaeya poked his belly with a finger. “You can feel it inside that much?” Diluc glared at him. Then, he understood that Diluc was playing games with him and laughed. The feeling of Diluc’s hand moving away from his chest and down his body made his cock twitch. Good gods, it feels like my nerves are outside of my body. Hypersensitivity is really an understatement. He could just draw a circle on my arm and I’d get hard.\r\n\r\nReturning to the situation as soon as Diluc let his hand fall away, Kaeya wrapped his left hand around Diluc’s shaft and put his palm against the tip. Diluc had a slow look of terror on his face. Kaeya grinned. “Should only be another minute or two until my knot shrinks enough for me to move again. Can’t let you loosen up by then, though. Wouldn’t be any fun for either of us.”\r\n\r\n“Wait—”\r\n\r\nKaeya stroked him with his left hand and rubbed the tip with his right palm in circular motions. He watched as Diluc’s eyes rolled back, and felt his thighs twitch. Then, he tightened up. Kaeya felt himself come harder. Pleasure rolled up his spine. He was almost done… just a bit more…\r\n\r\nAs Diluc started to pant heavily, every breath harsh and loud, Kaeya’s hips bucked on their own, pushing his knot further inside for the last moments of the extended ejaculation. When Diluc started to lift his hands and put them over his mouth, Kaeya let his pheromones intensify. “Stop that. I want to hear you.”\r\n\r\nDiluc met his eyes. His pheromones swelled in the space between them, too. Kaeya laughed as dizziness struck him, but he forced more pheromones into the room. Diluc fought back in equal measure against the command, until Kaeya’s ejaculation stuttered— but then he remembered that he could release pheromones from his knot. Hadn’t Diluc been doing it unconsciously, last time?\r\nHe concentrated, but before he even thought about it, Diluc’s pheromones suddenly retreated. Kaeya raised an eyebrow at him, then looked down to realize that his legs had spread further apart. Smirking, Kaeya ground his palm against Diluc’s tip harder. He spasmed and moaned quietly, but his hands didn’t shift from the bedsheets. “Well done.”\r\n\r\nDiluc spat, “Fuck off.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure you don’t mean that,” he purred. “Don’t you want to come?”\r\n\r\n“How can I—” He gasped, twisting to his right, his left foot coming off the bed. “I feel gross. Aren’t you done yet? Hasn’t it already been twenty minutes?”\r\n\r\nKaeya grinned, pulling out slightly. “You’re right. It’s been that long. You got me hard all over again. Sorry.” He thrust back in and Diluc hissed between his teeth while Kaeya squeezed him, rubbing the slit all the while. “But, gross? If it’s gross, then it’s exposure therapy that’s required, right?”\r\n\r\nDiluc’s eyes widened. Then, Kaeya thrust against his prostate and shifted his grip. Diluc came with an abrupt, surprised gasp, arching off the bed. As he tried and failed to breathe steadily again, Kaeya captured his lips and kissed him, lifting his hips further away from the bed as he moved. Diluc’s mouth opened beneath his with more pliancy than usual, probably because he was worn out already, but Kaeya felt as if he hadn’t even started. So this is a real rut, huh? Pretty scary.\r\n\r\nWith every thrust, a Diluc let out a small sound in the back of his throat, not quite a moan, but it was more than usual and better than nothing. Kaeya didn’t remember when his fangs had retracted, but Diluc’s hadn’t, and the sting of those strong pheromones on his tongue was like brandy. Fuck, this is so good. He must have said it out loud, because he felt an amused smile against his lips, before Diluc tugged on his lower lip with his teeth. Kaeya felt his scent gland throb, and he pulled away from their kiss.\r\n\r\nTracing his dripping fangs across Diluc’s neck, he let the pheromones fall onto the wounds atop his scent gland. Diluc inhaled sharply, and Kaeya felt the pull of the sheets as his toes curled into them. \r\nKaeya licked the wounds, having no intention to bite him anymore— it would probably hurt.\r\n\r\nDiluc asked, somewhat breathlessly, “Why do you go even slower when you’re in rut?”\r\n\r\nKaeya raised an eyebrow. “Is that a problem?”\r\n\r\n“Get it over with already, or we’ll actually be at this for twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\n“It’s bold of you to assume I don’t want to be at this for twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\nDiluc glared up at him. “Go faster.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to,” he said with a smile, kissing Diluc again. “You’re the one helping me, so shouldn’t you just play along with me?” Diluc didn’t open his mouth, so Kaeya bit his nose playfully as he rolled his hips, grinding against him instead of thrusting, just to go more slowly. “Come on, give me a kiss.”\r\n\r\nHe parted his lips, looking insincere, so Kaeya didn’t both with the kiss. Instead, sliding his hands to the base of Diluc’s spine, he lifted him up. Then, while Diluc looked confused and held his shoulders, Kaeya got to his feet and walked across the room, not pulling out. After the second step, Diluc held on more desperately, tightening up. Kaeya sucked in a breath between his teeth. “Hey, if you do that, I’ll drop you.”\r\n\r\n“Then pull out,” he hissed, but Kaeya cut him off when he reached an empty part of the wall, and changed his grip. Diluc’s face turned very red. “Are you serious?”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you don’t want to do this for twenty-four hours, I should try to tire myself out, no?”\r\n\r\nDiluc laughed, in a scandalized way, as Kaeya lifted him higher against the wall. “You just want to try against a wall. If it was about getting tired you’d do it in the middle of the room. This has nothing to do with stamina— ah! Fuck—”\r\n\r\nThe words left him as Kaeya started to move, but he didn’t bother quickening his pace. He felt like he had infinite energy, and Diluc did him the favour of putting most of his weight on the wall, not his hands. He watched with no shortage of pleasure as Diluc’s face changed, his lashed fluttering as his eyes closed, his features seeming to soften in pleasure as he tipped his head back and parted his lips. His chest rose and fell unevenly, and his hair fell across his chest and shoulders in a soft-looking mess.\r\nKaeya found himself smiling. He hadn’t really expected to sober up during his rut, but he guessed, based on how it had been during Diluc’s rut, that it got better after the first ejaculation. Leaning forward as he moved, Kaeya kissed his cheek. “You’re really handsome, you know?” Diluc only gasped in reply as Kaeya changed his angle, letting Diluc drop down the wall a bit. “With some colour in your cheeks and something other than indifference on your face, you’re so beautiful that it makes my chest hurt.”\r\n\r\n“Spare me the—” He cut off, his nails scratching a bit as Kaeya found his prostate. “Flattery—”\r\n\r\n“I mean it.” Closing his eyes, he kissed Diluc’s jaw, his other cheek, his eyelids, his lower lip. “It’s either the fact that I love you or that you’re really handsome enough for it to be painful.”\r\n\r\nDiluc opened his eyes, let go of Kaeya’s shoulders, and grabbed his face. Smiling, Kaeya let Diluc pull him forward and surrendered to a passionate kiss that made his knees feel a bit weak. He opened his mouth to Diluc and quickened his pace somewhat, just to feel the soft vibration of a groan in his throat as Diluc’s hands tangled in his hair. I love you. It was the only thought in Kaeya’s head, somehow. He whispered it against Diluc’s lips, and Diluc answered breathily, almost inaudibly.\r\n\r\nDiluc moaned more sweetly when Kaeya started to direct every thrust toward his prostate. He felt Diluc untie his hair, probably without the intention of doing so, and heard the cord fall to the floor with a soft thump. Kaeya changed the tide of their kiss, or Diluc let him, their tongues twining as their fangs lengthened again, pheromones and panting breaths mixing together in the space between them. The grip Diluc had on his hair turned savage as he crushed their lips together, and Kaeya could feel Diluc’s desperation in his own chest. It was something about the rut, probably.\r\n\r\nSomething about the way they had been able to knot without any omega-like scents or tricks. \r\n\r\nSomething about the way that Diluc had bared his throat just to fix his head, to fix his alpha, to remind him that he wasn’t that crying kid tied to a chair in a dark room anymore. Something about the way that Diluc said words he hardly ever said, words like ‘love,’ earnest words like ‘I’m sorry,’ words that they hardly exchanged since they had mended things between them years ago.\r\n\r\nKaeya wished that they could join, momentarily become a single person, merge not just their bodies but their souls, so he could put the strain in his chest at ease. He knew that the ache beneath his breast was the desire to be closer, impossibly close— it was impossible. They lost themselves in each other, briefly, kissing while they inhaled and exhaled the same particles of air, urgently.\r\n\r\nAs he felt his release approaching, Kaeya thrust with more strength, but even though the sounds of pleasure crept up Diluc’s throat, he refused to pull away from Kaeya’s lips. He felt a bit dizzy, short of air, but he didn’t care— He felt his knot swell, and Diluc shifted his hands to his shoulders as he pushed it inside. He could feel the dripping of a few tears amidst the sweat on their abdomens as their bodies locked together, against nature and against instinct.\r\n\r\nHe wasn’t sure if they were his tears or Diluc’s, but he didn’t care. As soon as he was inside, he felt the ejaculation shudder through his body, and his knees buckled, but he forced the strength back into them. He reached between their bodies to stroke Diluc, only to find that he had already come.\r\n\r\nFinally pulling away from their kiss, gasping more than breathing, Kaeya stared in silent shock. Diluc was shaking a bit, collapsed against the wall as his sides and chest heaved. Absently, Kaeya traced his finger through the mess on Diluc’s abdomen. “I didn’t touch you.”\r\n\r\nDiluc only exhaled shakily in reply, not even opening his eyes.\r\n\r\nKaeya wasn’t so confident in his ability to go back to the bed, not while his entire body, from the soles of his feet touching the ground, felt like his cock. Still, he put in the effort, stumbling at the last steps and falling quite gracelessly on his back. Despite the strain it must have put on him, Diluc didn’t even sit upright when he fell on top of Kaeya, lying boneless for a few moments.\r\n\r\nThen, while Kaeya had closed his eyes and let himself succumb to the feeling of the continuous orgasm, his skin feeling close to turning to ash from the temperature, Diluc finally sat upright. The movement made some semen spill past Kaeya’s knot. Diluc made a face as if he hated the feeling, but somewhat beyond himself, not really thinking, Kaeya flipped them over again and lifted Diluc’s hips off the bed so that nothing would go out.\r\n\r\nDiluc finally spoke. “You’re really gross. Are you there, alpha? I’m talking to you.”\r\n\r\nKaeya laughed. “I hit him on the head pretty hard when you nearly strangled me.”\r\n\r\n“He’s still kicking, though,” Diluc sighed, seeming to give up on changing positions. “Otherwise you wouldn’t bother with keeping this inside me,” he added, reaching between them to wipe away some of the semen that had leaked out. He looked disgusted, impressed, and mildly entertained. “Archons above.”\r\n\r\n“It might not be appropriate to invoke holy names right now, Luc.”\r\n\r\nHe burst out with laughter, saccharine laughter, his skin sticky with sweat, his cheeks flushed from exertion. He was incredibly charming, looking half-exhausted and half-relieved. Kaeya didn’t really know what to do with himself, so he leaned over and kissed Diluc’s brow. In return, Diluc pulled him down with an arm looped around his neck and said, “Just lie on me. It’s fine.”\r\n\r\nDiluc took his weight and played with his hair. During his rut, Diluc hadn’t had the presence of mind to do that sort of thing. Right now, Kaeya didn’t have the presence of mind to do anything either— it seemed that everything in his body was directed at his genitals. As Diluc braided his hair and hummed the tune of a really obscene tavern song, Kaeya chuckled and closed his eyes. Every time Diluc’s knuckles brushed his shoulder, he shuddered, pleasure arcing up his spine.\r\n\r\nHe hummed. “You’re oversensitive.”\r\n\r\n“You were, too.”\r\n\r\n“I just didn’t expect it,” he said, with a wicked smile in his voice. “Seeing as you try so hard to keep your composure while you’re at it. It must have been a real workout to walk to the wall.”\r\n\r\nKaeya chuckled darkly. “I’ll show you a real workout. Fifteen, right?”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen?”\r\n\r\n“An adult male alpha our age can ejaculate fifteen times during his rut without any discomfort, right? A low number compared to twenty-five, for an eighteen-year old alpha, though. It’s a shame we’re not that young anymore.” He glanced toward the clock on the wall. “Oh, lovely. It’s only been three hours. Well, an hour for every time I’ve come… are you up for it, Luc?”\r\n\r\nDiluc looked mildly horrified. “You’re joking.” Kaeya only smiled. “You’re a lunatic.”\r\n\r\n“Which is it? Am I joking, or am I a lunatic?”\r\n\r\nHe squirmed, clearly trying to get free, but Kaeya’s knot was a long time away from deflating enough to allow their painless separation. “Kaeya, I swear to Celestia, if you actually go through with this, I will never heat your baths again in all my life.”\r\n\r\n“And let me be hypothermic? I doubt it. Try a different threat, darling.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t have sex with you for a year.”\r\n\r\nThe threat was honest enough; Diluc had vanished for four years without even seeing him and had been perfectly fine. Kaeya laughed, though, and said, “I don’t think you’d really resist me that much.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll discontinue Death After Noon.”\r\n\r\n“And lose all of your customers?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll ban you from the Angel’s Share.”\r\n\r\n“The Cat’s Tail exists.”\r\n\r\nDiluc held his gaze a moment longer, and then he said, “You’re horrible.”\r\n\r\nLaughing, Kaeya kissed his nose, and Diluc scrunched it up, hitting the side of his head lightly. “I’m glad that the proper, high-society Master Diluc loves someone as horrible as me.”\r\n\r\nHe tsked. “You’re also full of yourself, just so you know.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do go on. Music to my ears.” Diluc hmphed and said nothing else, but a little smile was pulling at the corners of his mouth. Kaeya kissed those corners until Diluc finally smiled, albeit reluctantly, and he swatted Kaeya away from him. Noticing the way Diluc swallowed every now and then, he asked, \r\n\r\n“Thirsty?”\r\n\r\nDiluc met his eyes, then nodded. “A bit.” Then, glancing downward, he said, “Not that I expect you to have the means to pour me a glass of water.”\r\n\r\nKaeya reached with his left hand to touch his Vision, resting beside Diluc’s on the nightstand, and he conjured an ice cube with his right hand, dropping it into Diluc’s mouth. After Diluc had melted it in his mouth and swallowed, he said, “You know, Kae, this’ll take a while to equate to a glass.”\r\n\r\n“Do you have other suggestions?” he asked, trying not to make any obscene sounds when Diluc shifted slightly, pushing him deeper inadvertently.\r\n\r\nDiluc blinked at him, but even though Kaeya pressed another ice cube to his lips, he spoke before taking it into his mouth. “You got bigger.”\r\n\r\n“It’s your fault. Stop moving around if you don’t want me to start moving too.”\r\n\r\nTen ice cubes later, his knot deflated and he pulled out with an embarrassing squelching sound. Semen flowed out, and he winced as Diluc’s ears turned a very dark shade of red. Mostly, he wanted to offer a bath, but his alpha whispered with a very insistent voice not to let any more of it out, so he pressed his thumb against Diluc’s hole. Diluc laughed. “You’re crazy.”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” he said, trying and failing to pull his hand away. “I think Mr. Wolf is getting— ah.” Suddenly, a wave of unbidden pleasure moved through his body again, much like it had at the beginning. Since Diluc seemed to be waiting for an answer rather anxiously, he finished, “A bit impatient.”\r\n\r\nDiluc stared at him for a moment, then laughed as if he was being tickled.\r\n\r\nKaeya frowned. “What’s funny?”\r\n\r\nHe kept on cackling, and between his gasps of amusement, he said, “Oh, Archons, you’re having heat flashes! Ahahaha! Only kids get those! What are you, sixteen?” He couldn’t seem to stop laughing.\r\n\r\nKaeya asked, “Is that what they’re called?” Diluc was beyond himself with amusement. “I think the Khaenri’ahn term translates more like ‘love pains.’” Diluc wiped his eyes, seeming to recover from his laughter as Kaeya reasoned, “It must be because it’s my first real rut. The first one didn’t involve much… pleasure, really.”\r\n\r\nDiluc stopped laughing entirely. His gaze was more serious. “What were your ruts really like, all these years? You told me that you just curled into a ball and sat in a corner.”\r\n\r\nChuckling, somewhat bitterly, he said, “Well, you think I don’t cry often, but it used to hurt more than breaking bones. Sometimes I fainted. A lot of crying, fading in and out of consciousness, and things like that.” Diluc seemed upset, so he added, “It’s not meant to be that way. I just failed my end of the session. I was supposed to accept the guy as my prime alpha. I didn’t. They didn’t exactly make the rules clear enough, so I just resisted until I passed out.”\r\n\r\nDiluc sat upright, pushing Kaeya’s hair out of his eyes. “I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\nTurning his head, he kissed the palm of Diluc’s hand. “I’m okay.” Diluc leaned forward and kissed his cheek. He asked, “What were your ruts like when you were younger?”\r\n\r\nHe looked awkward for a moment, before he sighed. “In the spirit of honesty… frantic masturbation. I was just rutting into the sheets like an animal. Not very pleasant. I hated it, actually.”\r\n\r\nTrying to lighten the mood, he asked, “And who were you thinking about?”\r\n\r\nDiluc sighed. “Who do you think?” Kaeya grinned, and Diluc pinched his cheek, pulling on it until it hurt a bit. “Yes, how funny that I was desperate and lonely. Har-har.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, Kaeya realized, and then he flinched at the realization. Diluc raised an eyebrow. “We were still living in the same house when you had your fifth rut. That was when they discovered that your pheromone disorder was permanent. You were jerking off to me while I was in the next room?”\r\n\r\nHe opened and closed his mouth, as if swallowing words. Then, turning his gaze away, he said, bitingly, “It’s not like I didn’t hear you that time you brought a girl home and accidentally said my name.”\r\n\r\nKaeya felt his face get hot. “Wait, you had said that you weren’t going to be home.” Diluc glared, but said nothing. “You… wanted to listen?” He laughed in disbelief. “We wasted a lot of time, huh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we did,” he said with a sigh. Then, after a moment, his eyebrows raised as he looked down at Kaeya’s groin region. “You’re still hard. Are you having heat flashes again?”\r\n\r\n“Awkwardly enough, yes.” And it’s getting difficult to keep talking to you normally.\r\n\r\nDiluc seemed to mull something over, before he finally let out a long breath and met Kaeya’s gaze again. Half-resolute, he said, “Well, at least we can make your first proper rut an enjoyable one.” He didn’t bother to let Kaeya process his words before kissing him.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of languid kissing, he registered the words, and then registered how much spend was dripping down Diluc’s thighs. Wasted, said his alpha, so he made haste and pushed Diluc onto his back. He was met with little resistance, but Diluc wasn’t aroused yet, so he set aside his instinct to just start fucking again. He kissed a line from Diluc’s scent gland to his hip, where he paused before opening his mouth. He ran his tongue over his fangs to check that he had retracted them fully before going down.\r\nAbove him, Diluc sighed with pleasure, letting his hands tangle in Kaeya’s hair. As bobbed his head, he resisted the temptation to use a hand to stroke himself, since it would be more worthwhile to wait and prolong it. He wondered, if he could easily release fifteen times, how many times left for Diluc? He had knotted once, so that was already a considerable exertion considering that he wasn’t in his rut. Then, twice after… so, maybe once or twice more before they were dry.\r\n\r\nThe thought was titillating. Would it come to that? He hoped so— all in one day? To see Diluc come untouched, and dry? At the thought, he redoubled his efforts, hearing Diluc’s breathing get harsh in the quietude. The silence was only interrupted by Diluc’s groans and the sounds of Kaeya sucking him off.\r\nHe pulled his mouth off to lick up the base of the shaft, to pay some attention to his testicles and perineum, before going back to the tip. As he teased the slit with his tongue, Diluc’s thighs flexed to either side of his head, abruptly. He’s close. Kaeya kept on teasing, wanting to lengthen the sounds of the moans that tumbled away from Diluc’s lips. As he worked at keeping Diluc on the edge of release, he traced the pads of his fingers along the insides of his thighs.\r\n\r\n“Kaeya, I—” He cut off, shuddering, his back arching off the mattress as his heels pushed into the sheets. Kaeya went down a bit further, starting to suck again. “Ah! Kae, wait, wait— Kaeya, please—”\r\nPrayers fell through the air until his fingers flinched in Kaeya’s hair. Taking him to the hilt, Kaeya forced the muscles of his throat to tighten slightly. Diluc let out a long, brilliant moan of pleasure as he came, and Kaeya swallowed before pulling off. He watched for a moment as Diluc’s body flinched, his mind still trapped in the throes of ecstasy. Smiling to himself, he turned Diluc onto his stomach and gripped his hips. As he lined himself up, Diluc regained himself enough to ask, “Wait, why this position?”\r\n\r\nKaeya started to push in, and every catch of Diluc’s breathing as he did was musical. “So that I can go as slow as I’d like without you chastising me.”\r\n\r\nDiluc managed to say, “You really are a tease.” With a final, strong thrust, he bottomed out. Diluc cursed, his knees sliding apart inadvertently. As Kaeya moved, his head was clear enough that he could finally hear the obscene squelching sound, the noise of their skin slapping, and the bed creaking. It’s loud enough without Diluc making a sound. But if I were him, I’d rather hear my own voice than these sounds…\r\n\r\nWhile he moved, he asked, “Isn’t it uncomfortable to be quiet when the sounds are so…”\r\n\r\nDiluc snapped, “Shut up. Don’t make fun of me. It’s your fault, you came inside.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” he said, laughing as he leaned closer. He pressed his chest to Diluc’s back and spread his legs a bit further apart with his knees. Diluc made a noise of surprise that quickly turned to a shuddering groan as his cock pressed against the sheets.\r\n\r\nKaeya licked across his nape, and a somewhat insane urge overcame him to bite the pale skin there, even though it wasn’t exactly the position of his scent gland. Diluc seemed to realize that he was paying too much attention to the back of his neck. “Hey, I’m not an omega. Don’t bite me there.”\r\n\r\n“Where can I bite you?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t bite me.”\r\n\r\nIgnoring him, he nipped at the skin of Diluc’s shoulders as he kept up a lazy pace. The pleasure built between them slowly and waveringly, occasionally intense and then receding with some frustration on Diluc’s part. Then, suddenly, Diluc tightened around him. Kaeya reached underneath him and wrapped a hand around his cock, dripping precum. As he moved his hand, Diluc started to squirm underneath him, his arms shaking before they gave out and he fell forward even further. Only Kaeya’s left hand kept his hips up slightly. Diluc was jolting with every stroke of Kaeya’s hand, overstimulated, and Kaeya saw the tears collecting at the corners of his eyes.\r\n\r\nLeaning down, he licked them away, asking, “Is it too much?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “but I know you’re doing it on purpose.”\r\n\r\nKaeya smirked and went faster, but only with his hand. He maintained the same rhythm with his hips, grinding against Diluc’s prostate with every thrust and every pull outward. When Diluc started to struggle against him, his hips pushing upward, his fingers digging into the sheets, Kaeya knew that it was going to be the last ejaculation. He was out of breath, twitching under Kaeya’s hand, but only leaking a little bit onto the bed. It was when Kaeya tilted his head to the side with his left hand and leaned over to close his teeth around Diluc’s scent gland that he pulsed a single time, sullying the sheets.\r\n\r\nHe was silent that time, but when Kaeya didn’t stop moving his hand even when it was over, Diluc started to beg him to stop. He injected more pheromones into Diluc’s scent gland— this was the real reason for the position. Kaeya had read somewhere that it was more common for a male alpha to have a dry orgasm if he was being dominated by another alpha. Diluc was pleading incoherently, his body twitching as he wept from the overstimulation.\r\n\r\nAs Diluc tightened around him sporadically, he felt his knot growing and was forced to thrust more roughly to keep up the stimulation. Diluc’s back arched, his stomach pressing against the bed as his hips lifted higher, and his head. The lines of his throat stretched and gave Kaeya better access, so he pushed in a final glandful of pheromones before withdrawing. He reached down and started to massage Diluc’s testicles at the same time as stroking him. When Diluc started to gasp, his eyes wide, Kaeya thrust his knot inside and came.\r\n\r\nDiluc shuddered underneath him, his alpha musk spreading around the room desperately, uselessly, as he came without any success. Kaeya shushed him, kissing his scent gland and his shoulders. The feeling of Diluc clenching and unclenching around him uncontrollably was bliss. When Kaeya started to move his hand again, slowly, Diluc forced himself to speak properly. “Stop,” he said, not very firmly.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t want to?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t take it anymore—\"\r\n\r\n“But you feel good, right?” he asked, teasing the tip with one finger. He started to pull out, not that he achieved much aside from startling Diluc and rubbing his knot against the nerves at his entrance.\r\n\r\nDiluc gasped out, “I’m still coming, so please, just stop touching—” When Kaeya did not relent, he made a sound that was close to a whimper and stopped struggling.\r\n\r\nClosing his eyes, Kaeya let himself enjoy the lingering, intense feeling of pleasure between their bodies. When he pulled out, minutes later, Diluc rolled onto his back and said, exhausted, “No more.”\r\n\r\n“Uh, Luc.” Diluc opened one eye and Kaeya bowed his head, feeling sorry. “I’m still hard.”\r\n\r\nDiluc stared at him numbly, then wiped his face with both hands before whispering, “Fuck.”\r\n\r\n“You’re the best,” Kaeya said, leaning down to kiss him.\r\n\r\nAgainst his lips, Diluc said, “I know that.” Then, somewhat tiredly, he returned the kiss and pulled Kaeya down again. His craving for mulled wine was as strong as his lust as he breathed Diluc’s smoky scent and tasted the alcohol-like arousal in his pheromones.\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and yet again lost himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning, he woke up with blurry vision and something warm against his body. And around him. Glancing down, he could see that he had fallen asleep inside of Diluc. Oh, he’s going to kill me if he wakes up, Kaeya thought, trying desperately not to laugh. They had really gone at it too hard. Not fifteen times, but still enough that Diluc had ended it by saying that he was going to twist Kaeya’s balls off.\r\n\r\nStill, that had been said while Kaeya had been stuck with a knot, so they seemed to have dozed off after that threat. Awkwardly, Diluc had one leg over Kaeya’s waist. It must have been uncomfortable to sleep like that… Carefully, Kaeya pulled out and grimaced when he saw how much there was leaking out. Yikes. Bath. Now. Before he has the chance to stand up and realize.\r\n\r\nCautiously, he got out of bed. Before he went to the bathing room, he paused to open the nightstand and take out the engagement ring. He thought over many things, until he finally decided and took action. Then, having finished with that, he washed himself and prepared a bath for Diluc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Diluc woke up, he felt stiff. His back hurt, his thighs hurt, his scent gland hurt, and his knees were so weak that he hardly stood straight. When he did, he blanched. A rush of fluid moved through his lower body, but he wasn’t quick enough to react, and it dripped down his legs. Oh, Archons. Kaeya wasn’t in the room, but he felt completely humiliated. Fuck. Ashamed, barely able to stagger toward the bathing room, he dragged himself though his chambers, naked.\r\n\r\nWhere is he? he wondered, when he finally made it to the bathing room. Kaeya wasn’t there, but there was a bath, and his Vision was on a stool beside it. He heated the water, but before getting inside, he reached behind himself and tried to get as much out as he could. He knew that Kaeya wasn’t anywhere to be seen to spare him the embarrassment, but he couldn’t remember if Kaeya had to go on a patrol this morning or not. Diluc wanted to at least see if he was feeling alright.\r\n\r\nA bit annoyed, Diluc thought, Well, he’d better be alright, considering how much I endured for his sake. Fucking Celestia. It’s not even all out yet? When he was sick of prodding himself and feeling it move down the insides of his thighs, he poured a bucket of water over himself and then got into the tub.\r\nHis stomach hurt a bit, but it was more like discomfort than pain, so he ignored it and reached for the soap. He felt better after soaking for a few minutes, his earlier feelings of shame washed away by the steam. As he cleaned his hair, there was a knock, and Kaeya’s voice. “Can I come in?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.” Kaeya entered, with breakfast and a pitcher of water. Diluc almost laughed— he was actually tempted to down the entire pitcher. “Good morning.”\r\n\r\nKaeya sat down on the stool near the tub and asked, “How are you feeling?”\r\n\r\n“I’m fine,” he said, as Kaeya poured a glass of water for him. He leaned back to rinse his hair before asking in return, “How are you? Symptoms gone? Feeling clear-headed?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded. “Yes, it’s over. But, I think I overdid it. You’re not too sore?”\r\n\r\n“I am sore, but I’m not made of porcelain. I’ll be fine. And going overboard is normal,” Diluc sighed, reaching to drink from the glass of water before setting it down on the tray again for Kaeya to refill. “Especially since I’m not an omega. I can’t calm you down.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want an omega,” he said, with a small smile. “And, just for the record, I do think that you’re the only person who could help me, even though you said you couldn’t since you’re an alpha.”\r\n\r\nDiluc met his eyes, saw only honesty in them, and shook his head. “Don’t be unusually sweet.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help it. Your sweetness is still lingering in my mouth.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a real handful.” He took up the glass and drained it again, set it down again.\r\n\r\n“I love you.”\r\n\r\nDiluc glanced at him sidelong, but couldn’t resist a small smile. “I love you, too.” Kaeya leaned over to kiss him chastely, before gesturing in a circular motion at the pastries on the tray. Diluc considered, then said, “The one with chocolate.”\r\n\r\nKaeya lifted it in front of his mouth and he took a bite before continuing to wash himself. Kaeya ate the other half and seemed to be thinking about something. After a moment, he asked, “Why don’t we take the day off? You shouldn’t push yourself too much today, and honestly, I’m a bit tired, too. Let’s go out for a… a leisurely hike, or something. Crack open a bottle of your famous apple cider and sit around.”\r\n“Sounds good to me,” he said, with a shrug. “I don’t have any meetings today.”\r\n\r\n“Great.” Kaeya smiled, but Diluc felt like there was something he hadn’t mentioned. After a few minutes more, in which Diluc finished bathing, drank the entire pitcher of water, and ate half of the pastries on the plate, he got to his feet and dried off. Just before he started to get dressed, Kaeya added, “Thank you. For last night. For everything.”\r\n\r\nDiluc shook his head. “You don’t need to thank me.”\r\n\r\nKaeya hesitated, but then he opened the door and said, “I’m going to take the tray downstairs.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll meet you at the front door.”\r\n\r\n“Alright.” With that, he left the bathing room, and Diluc opened the closet. He was glad that Kaeya had prepared the clothes for him, but it wasn’t worth mentioning, since Kaeya would say that it was the least he could do. He dressed more causally than usual, leaving his coat and the dagger sheath he usually strapped to his thigh behind. For a leisurely hike, his Vision was enough, especially if Kaeya was going to accompany him. He looked around for his gloves, but didn’t find them, so he stopped by his bedroom again.\r\n\r\nIt smelled like their pheromones so strongly that he staggered back. After opening the windows, he found his gloves on the desk and put them on. First, the right hand, and then the—\r\n\r\nLeft.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nWhat is…? Turning the glove over, he watched something silver fall into his hand. A ring. It was plain, aside from the tasteful, traditional patterns carved on it. He checked the inside and found that an owl and a peacock had been drawn minutely in gold. Chuckling to himself, he put the ring on his fourth finger and then his glove. That’s why you looked nervous? I guess even you can’t flirt your way through everything.\r\n\r\nAs he walked down the stairs, he wondered how to tell Kaeya that he was not too forward to put the ring in his glove. Outside, the day was bright and the sky was wide; the crystalflies were gone though, so they had slept in quite a lot. When Kaeya glanced over his shoulder at him from the end of the path, he decided. Diluc pulled his glove off, raising his hand in the air in a way that would seem like a greeting.\r\n\r\nKaeya stared for a moment, before he smiled and lifted his own hand. The sunlight gleamed on the band there, only a shimmer of light in the distance from where Diluc stood. He smiled to himself before starting to walk down the path toward Kaeya. It was a good morning, the dawn of a fine day.', 'kaeluc.jpg', '2021-04-26 11:15:38.508558', '2021-04-26 11:29:44.370128', '0', '1', 'melting_mid_season2', '1', '3', 'Melting Mid-season');
